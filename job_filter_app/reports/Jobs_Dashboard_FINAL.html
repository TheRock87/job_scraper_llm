Previously denoted as the Future System Operator (or FSO), the new National Energy System Operator is the independent body responsible for planning Great Britain\u2019s electricity and gas networks and operating the electricity system.\n\n\nThe ESO, including all its existing roles, are now at the heart of the new National Energy System Operator. As NESO, we will build on our existing roles, capabilities, and ways of working significantly to create an organisation the energy system and its users\u2019 need. Our new capabilities will enable us to look across vectors, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen, and crucially consider the trade\\-offs between them.\n\n\nThe organisation is set up as a public corporation with its own Board of independent directors, with complete operational independence from government, the regulator, and all commercial interest. As was the ESO, NESO will be licenced and regulated by Ofgem through price control agreements and obligated to identify optimal solutions to system operations and planning in the most sustainable, affordable, and secure way for all.\n\n\nThe time to deliver is now. As part of our team, you won\u2019t just be touching the lives of almost everyone in Great Britain \u2013 you\u2019ll be shaping the way we use and consume energy for generations to come.\n\n**More Information**\n--------------------\n\n  \n\nThis role closes on **13th July at 23:59**, however we encourage candidates to submit their application as early as possible and not wait until the published closing date as this can vary.\n\n  \n\nWe work towards the highest standards in everything we do, including how we support, value, and develop our people.

In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks.

This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.*\n*I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.\"*\n**How You Will Make An Impact**\n* Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies\n* Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A\/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies\n* Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth\n* Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency\n\n\n**Preferred Experience**\n* Bachelor\u2019s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline\n* 1\\-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science\/business analysis\n* High level of comfort with SQL or Python\n\n\n**Who You Are**\n* You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles\n* You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front\\-line employees to the company\u2019s C\\-suite\n* You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence\n\n\n*While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.*\n*Jerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.
