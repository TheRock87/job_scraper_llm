The Stanford Accelerator for Learning focuses on learning challenges most in need of new discoveries, evidence, and solutions and where we believe Stanford can make the most difference. Those include: adult \\& workforce learning, digital learning, early childhood education and development, equity in learning, learning differences, and policy \\& systems change. The Stanford Center on Early Childhood (SCEC) is an initiative of the Stanford Accelerator for Learning. The SCEC leverages the current moment of revolutionary science and fosters deep omnidirectional collaboration across sectors, seeking to change the way that research in early childhood is conducted, communicated, and utilized, with the overarching goal that each and every child thrives from the start.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Position Summary**\n RAPID began as a program of two national surveys of households with children under age 6 and the child care workforce.

The survey and data inform policy, advocacy, academic, parent and practitioner audiences on the experiences, challenges, and strengths of parents of young children and child care providers. The goal is to support parent\\- and provider\\-driven policies and programs that equitably and effectively serve families, providers, and young children.\n   \n\n  \n\n RAPID is now implemented in community, state, and national contexts, working in partnership with local organizations and launching oversampling efforts in several states.
