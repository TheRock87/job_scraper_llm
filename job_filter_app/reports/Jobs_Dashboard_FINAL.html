Our new capabilities will enable us to look across vectors, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen, and crucially consider the trade\\-offs between them.\n   \n\n  \n\n The organisation is set up as a public corporation with its own Board of independent directors, with complete operational independence from government, the regulator, and all commercial interest. As was the ESO, NESO will be licenced and regulated by Ofgem through price control agreements and obligated to identify optimal solutions to system operations and planning in the most sustainable, affordable, and secure way for all.\n   \n\n  \n\n The time to deliver is now. As part of our team, you won\u2019t just be touching the lives of almost everyone in Great Britain \u2013 you\u2019ll be shaping the way we use and consume energy for generations to come.\n   \n\n  \n\n**More Information**\n This role closes on\n **13th July at 23:59** \n , however we encourage candidates to submit their application as early as possible and not wait until the published closing date as this can vary.\n   \n\n  \n\n We work towards the highest standards in everything we do, including how we support, value, and develop our people.
