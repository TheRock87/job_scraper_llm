As AI systems become ubiquitous in many areas of life, including education and work, it is essential that they are better understood by a variety of stakeholders. This includes different types of end\\-users in different areas, such as AI engineers that create those systems, managers that deal with the embedding of AI systems in their organizations, educators or trainers in various domains, or non\\-expert audiences. For these, technical knowledge about AI technologies and related regulations (e.g., EU AI Act) is increasingly important. Such knowledge also includes critical reflection on and healthy skepticism towards the outputs of AI systems, including knowledge of limitations and biases.\n\n\n\nA key challenge lies in how to efficiently and effectively equip these stakeholders to acquire (subsets of) the knowledge that they require for performing their various tasks. In this thesis, the aim is to explore various methods for AI knowledge communication and co\\-production relying on formal knowledge representation (to represent different expertise levels) and advanced visual interactions.

That's for good reason\u2014the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.\n   \n\n  \n\n We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer\\-to\\-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...\n   \n\n  \n\n****How you\u2019ll help us achieve it****\n Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users.

You\u2019ll own the full cycle: defining the right approach, implementing it, and shipping it in production.\n   \n\n  \n\n This role is highly experimentation\\-driven: you\u2019ll be able to rapidly test ideas, learn from real user feedback, and iterate quickly.\n   \n\n  \n\n We\u2019re looking for someone who is product\\-minded, hands\\-on, and pragmatic: a data scientist who sees beyond models and algorithms and thinks deeply about how data connects to intuitive user behavior and real\\-world impact.\n   \n\n  \n\n**In This Role You\u2019ll**\n* Be part of a multidisciplinary team, working with engineers, data analysts, economists and a product manager.\n* Focus on advanced analytics and machine learning problems, delivering them end\\-to\\-end independently.\n* Prioritise work and shape your own approach in a way that maximises the positive impact on both users and the business.\n* Engage not just with business metrics, but also collaborate closely with Operations teams to understand the real\\-world outcomes and impact of your work.\n\n\n****Key Details****\n* You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC \\-5 and \\+2\\) with reliable Internet access.\n* Wave covers travel once per year to one of our operating countries in Africa, as well as a yearly stipend of $1,200 to meet with coworkers.\n* Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula.

A Master's or PhD is a plus.\n+ 4\\+ years experience in applied data science or similar experience.\n+ Demonstrated experience with data analysis, machine learning and product A\/B tests.\n+ Experience in using advanced analytics for optimising targeting, rewards or incentive programs is a big plus.\n\n* Technical skills\n+ Proficiency in applying machine learning methods to solve business problems.\n+ Very strong Python skills with expertise in data manipulation, analysis and machine learning. Must be comfortable writing code that runs in production.\n+ Competent in SQL.\n+ Solid foundation in probability and statistics.\n\n\n****You might be a good fit if you****\n* Thrive on spotting key problems and finding the fastest, most effective solutions.\n* Enjoy and excel at working on machine learning and statistics problems.\n* Quickly build and validate proof\\-of\\-concept solutions, refining based on real\\-world feedback.\n* Prefer pragmatic approaches but apply complex methods when the impact is worth it.\n* Work iteratively, knowing when a project is \u201cgood enough\u201d to avoid over\\-polishing.\n* Communicate insights clearly to all audiences and make confident, data\\-driven recommendations.\n\n\n**Our team**\n* We have a rapidly growing in\\-country team in Senegal, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mali, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, and Uganda, plus remote team members spread across the world.\n* We're deeply passionate about our mission of bringing radically affordable financial services to the people who need them most.\n* We foster autonomy for our employees.

In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say \"key,\" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business\\-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C\\-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).*\n*The benefit of being a digital\\-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.*\n*I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.\"*\n**How You Will Make An Impact**\n* Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies\n* Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A\/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies\n* Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth\n* Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency\n\n\n**Preferred Experience**\n* Bachelor\u2019s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline\n* 1\\-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science\/business analysis\n* High level of comfort with SQL or Python\n\n\n**Who You Are**\n* You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles\n* You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front\\-line employees to the company\u2019s C\\-suite\n* You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence\n\n\n*While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.*\n*Jerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

The IBA Can Be Used For Such Things As:\n   \n\n  \n\n IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee\u2019s monthly compensation rate.

That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Stock Options**\n Because Northstrat is an employee\\-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Lifelong Learning**\n Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment.
