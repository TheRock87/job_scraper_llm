In the beginning, Glasswall was one of only two file sanitisation filters in the US Intelligence Community\u2019s highly classified networks. We are rated \\#1 by the National Security Agency. We designed Glasswall CDR to protect businesses against the most advanced file\\-based threats. Today, we\u2019re trusted by commercial and government organisations around the world.\n \n\n\n\n In June 2025 Glasswall officially entered a new era of growth and innovation having been acquired by the leading private equity firm, PSG Equity. This marks a significant milestone for our company\u2014one that underscores the strength of our business, the dedication of our team, and the exciting potential that lies ahead.\n \n\n\n\n With PSG\u2019s strong track record of scaling high\\-growth cybersecurity and technology businesses, we are better positioned than ever to accelerate innovation, expand into new markets, and deliver even greater value to our clients, employees, and stakeholders.\n \n\n\n\n Cybersecurity is a mission\\-critical field, and we\u2019ve always believed that staying ahead means moving faster, continually adapting to meet new challenges and investing more boldly in the future. This partnership empowers us to do exactly that\u2014while maintaining the same leadership, values, and commitment to excellence that have brought us this far\n \n\n\n\n We\u2019re excited for what\u2019s to come\u2014so now is a great time for you to join us on our journey.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Inclusion** \n\n\n\n\n At Glasswall we believe that diversity of people and thought are central to our purpose.

This includes diversity in every sense of the word: those with different backgrounds, ages, ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, ways of thinking and those with disabilities or neurodivergent conditions. We therefore welcome and encourage applications from everyone, including those from groups that are under\\-represented in our workforce.\n \n\n\n\n One of our corporate objectives is to ensure that the organisational health of the firm is highly rated by our employees. We believe that this is only possible if we promote a culture of inclusion and respect across our business. Every six months we survey employees on a range of questions relating to our organisational health. This holds a mirror\\-up to a business and ensures that we can focus on where we need to do better.\n \n\n\n\n We have an Organisational Health Committee, which is chaired by a non\\-executive position. The panel has been formed to guide the leadership in taking positive action that supports a good work\\-life balance, family friendly relations and to be inviting to a diverse range of potential employees.\n \n\n\n\n We also have a Women in Technology Group which has been formed to promote balance in the way that we communicate with, promote, encourage, and support people across our business.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Work\/Life Balance:** \n\n\n\n\n Our team puts a high value on work\\-live balance.

By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions \u2013 helping people travel better and save more on their trips.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers \u2013 with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.\n   \n\n  \n\n While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we\u2019ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world\u2019s largest brands.\n   \n\n  \n\n Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners\u2019 direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\\-to\\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.\n   \n\n  \n\n Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company\u2019s recent growth:\n   \n\n  \n\n Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year.

As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.\n   \n\n  \n\n Featured in Apple\u2019s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month.

Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.\n   \n\n  \n\n From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n**About the team** \n\n\n\n\n We don't build pricing models, we build the driving intelligence that feeds them. Our mission is to drive safer roads and fairer insurance through data.\n \n\n\n\n The Telematics team transforms raw phone sensor data into meaningful insights about how people drive. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, we process high\\-frequency data to extract behavioural signals that power our understanding of driving quality, context, and risk.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n**About the Role** \n\n\n\n\n As a Senior Data Scientist, you'll help define the future of behaviour\\-based insurance.

As part of the data science \\& analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in\\-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.\n   \n\n  \n\n Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible \u2013 insurance, buy\/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc \u2013 a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we\u2019ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI\\-powered chatbot \\& voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Here's what an ex\\-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:**\n*\"The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say \"key,\" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business\\-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C\\-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).*\n*The benefit of being a digital\\-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.*\n*I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.\"*\n**How You Will Make An Impact**\n* Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies\n* Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A\/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies\n* Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth\n* Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency\n\n\n**Preferred Experience**\n* Bachelor\u2019s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline\n* 1\\-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science\/business analysis\n* High level of comfort with SQL or Python\n\n\n**Who You Are**\n* You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles\n* You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front\\-line employees to the company\u2019s C\\-suite\n* You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence\n\n\n*While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.*\n*Jerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

Increasingly, data from third parties (including commercial private veterinary laboratories, veterinary practitioners and abattoirs) is also being harnessed to augment scanning surveillance outputs. The data and analyses are used to produce routine reports and other outputs relating to endemic diseases of animals in Great Britain for the benefit of a wide range of stakeholders, including the livestock industry, private veterinary surgeons and producers.\n\n\nThis new post is funded through the National Biosurveillance Programme (NBN), which is a component of the UK\u2019s Biological Security Strategy (BSS), which outlines the UK\u2019s cross government mission to achieve resilience to a spectrum of biological threats. The NBN aims to improve the UK\u2019s ability to characterise and report biological risks across the One Health spectrum, reliably and rapidly. This includes improving ways of working to better record, share and utilise surveillance outputs, and bringing data together to generate a holistic picture of risks.\n\n\nThe post sits within a dedicated multidisciplinary NBN team in APHA and will work closely with the SIU team, in particular the team of Data Analysts within SIU.\n\n### **Job description**\n\n\nThis role will provide a data and information management function directly contributing to the outputs of the animal health scanning surveillance network in Great Britain.\n\n\nThe successful applicant will be directly involved in the collection, curation and analysis of animal health scanning surveillance data primarily by building, updating and maintaining automated data ingestion and processing pipelines in a cloud\\-based environment using existing APHA surveillance data as well as animal health data from third party sources that augments current outputs and enhances APHA\u2019s scanning surveillance capabilities.\n\n\nThe post\\-holder will initially work with an existing developer team to define data handling capabilities within the SIU team and will be subsequently responsible for maintaining and scaling data ingestion processes to an increasing number of datasets.
