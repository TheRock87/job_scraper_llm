By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions \u2013 helping people travel better and save more on their trips.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers \u2013 with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.\n   \n\n  \n\n While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we\u2019ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world\u2019s largest brands.\n   \n\n  \n\n Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners\u2019 direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\\-to\\-end travel portals.

As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.\n   \n\n  \n\n Featured in Apple\u2019s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month.

The position is based at the Surrey Morphology Group at the University of Surrey, in Guildford, UK, and provides the opportunity to work in the vibrant and highly collegial research environment for which the SMG is renowned.\n\n**Background**\n\n\nThe NILOMORPH project aims to reconstruct the morphological evolution of the West Nilotic languages, spoken primarily in South Sudan and neighboring countries. These languages have developed some of the most remarkable morphological systems on the planet, where simultaneous manipulation of multiple phonological features (vowel length, vowel height, tone, phonation type) results in enormous paradigms marked solely by the modulation of vowel properties.\n\n\nThe NILOMORPH combines fieldwork, experimental methods, and historical linguistics to account for the phonological, morphological and psycholinguistic pathways that led to this unique outcome. The project is spread across multiple teams, based in the UK, France, Germany and the USA, and will make use of a diverse range of language data taken from multiple sources: ongoing fieldwork, previous studies, text corpora and newly\\-generated reconstructions, as well as well as the results of computational simulations and artificial language learning experiments.\n\n**Responsiblities**\n\n\nThe successful candidate will develop and execute a set of data management and analysis tools will enable the diverse international team of researchers to create, access and manipulate the language data that is central to the NILOMORPH project.\n\n\n As a core member of the Surrey\\-based team, the successful candidate will provide expert guidance on methods and tools for data analysis, including data design, data management protocols and statistical analysis. They will collaborate closely in the writing and dissemination of papers and presentations, and be expected to take initiative in the formulation of the research agenda.\n\n\n They will also participate in the broader activities both of the NILOMORPH group and of the Surrey Morphology Group (SMG).

We are leaders in the innovation and application of molecular toxicity data from 'omics technologies to support the hazard assessment of chemicals under European safety legislation. Our mission is to accelerate the world's transition towards safer chemicals without vertebrate animal testing, using molecular toxicity data to identify and characterise exposure\\-related hazards for regulatory approval.\n   \n\n  \n\n As interest and confidence in applying metabolomics and transcriptomics technologies to regulatory toxicology grows, so we are growing. We now seek to recruit a skilled Omics Data Scientist, complementing the strengths of our existing team. We succeed because of the strength of our science, our people, and our collaborative approach to working with our clients, who include regulators and chemical companies throughout the UK and Europe, as well as the European Commission. Our core values include fostering teamwork, and earning trust in the approach to our mission through all that we do. We operate hybrid working, with the city of Birmingham, UK, serving as our physical meeting hub.\n   \n\n  \n\n THE ROLE\n   \n\n  \n\n A company Scientist role powers the delivery of our projects by conducting and delivering on contract research, assisting in the development of new contract proposals, and contributing to exploratory research in the company's R\\&D programme. The Scientist works closely with Senior Scientists to conduct investigations and report scientific findings. We provide built\\-in career progression for Scientists through the learning and development of project planning and management skills, and by specialising in methods continually being improved by our R\\&D to solve real\\-world challenges in chemical safety. Our Scientists also co\\-author research publications.\n   \n\n  \n\n We seek a proven researcher and team player who speaks our language, the language of 'omics and 'omics data analysis, applied to human or animal biology. Applicants should have a PhD (or equivalent level of expertise) focused on applying metabolomics (primarily) or transcriptomics to either toxicology, human health\/disease or perturbation biology. The Scientist will be capable of performing reproducible computational and\/or statistical analyses of 'omics data to address toxicological questions, applying their knowledge of R or Python. They will review and incorporate insights from relevant scientific literature and databases to enable data analysis decisions and toxicological interpretation.\n   \n\n  \n\n Applicants should be motivated to apply their skills towards 21st century regulatory toxicology to help transition towards non\\-animal toxicity testing. Some knowledge of mechanistic or regulatory toxicology is highly desirable, as is experience working outside of academia.
