At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.  

  

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.

**About the team**


We don’t build pricing models, we build the driving intelligence that feeds them. Our mission is to drive safer roads and fairer insurance through data.


The Telematics team transforms raw phone sensor data into meaningful insights about how people drive. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, we process high\-frequency data to extract behavioural signals that power our understanding of driving quality, context, and risk.

**About the Role**


As a Senior Data Scientist, you’ll help define the future of behaviour\-based insurance. You’ll own the development of features and algorithms that detect driving patterns from sensors, test new hypotheses, and bring the most impactful insights into production.


You’ll work at the intersection of data science and engineering, generating scalable, real\-world insights from GPS, accelerometer, and other data

**What you will be doing**

* + Design and build robust behavioural features and factors from telematics data.

* + Develop end\-to\-end pipelines in Python and SQL, from quick heuristics to full ML models.

* + Prioritise simple, robust solutions that scale, whether rule\-based or ML\-driven.

* + Collaborate with Software Engineers and Product Managers to deploy features and validate impact.

* + Lead experiments, explore new ideas, and automate insight generation.

* + Translate complex sensor data into clear findings for internal use and product development.

**About You**

* + MSc or equivalent industry experience in a relevant field (e.g. Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Statistics). Candidates with a BSc and strong production experience will also be considered.

* + Experience delivering data science or data engineering solutions into production. You’re comfortable writing production\-grade code, not just notebooks.

* + Strong Python and SQL skills, including the basic libraries (Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn). You value writing clean, maintainable, and tested code.

* + Proven ability to design, build, and maintain data pipelines and tools from scratch that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable.

* + Strong communicator: able to translate ambiguous problems into structured, testable ideas and share insights across technical and non\-technical teams.

* + A growth mindset: you’re curious, open to feedback, and driven to keep learning and improving.


Nice to Have

* + Experience working with noisy, high\-frequency, or sensor/time\-series data (e.g. GPS, accelerometer), and making sense of it.
* + Experience with digital signal processing or sensor physics.

* + Experience with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS) and tooling like Docker, Kubernetes, or orchestration frameworks.


Background in insurance, mobile data, or behaviour modelling.  

* +

**About us**
------------

  

At National Energy System Operator (NESO), we’re aiming to operate a zero\-carbon electricity system for Great Britain by 2030 when there is sufficient renewable generation. This means change is needed across the whole system to transition away from fossil fuels and deliver clean, and affordable energy for everyone across the country.


Join a journey that matters.


Your energy, our future, together.

 **About the National Energy System Operator (NESO)**

  

In Autumn of 2024, the ESO transitioned to National Energy System Operator, or NESO for short. Previously denoted as the Future System Operator (or FSO), the new National Energy System Operator is the independent body responsible for planning Great Britain’s electricity and gas networks and operating the electricity system.


The ESO, including all its existing roles, are now at the heart of the new National Energy System Operator. As NESO, we will build on our existing roles, capabilities, and ways of working significantly to create an organisation the energy system and its users’ need. Our new capabilities will enable us to look across vectors, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen, and crucially consider the trade\-offs between them.


The organisation is set up as a public corporation with its own Board of independent directors, with complete operational independence from government, the regulator, and all commercial interest. As was the ESO, NESO will be licenced and regulated by Ofgem through price control agreements and obligated to identify optimal solutions to system operations and planning in the most sustainable, affordable, and secure way for all.


The time to deliver is now. As part of our team, you won’t just be touching the lives of almost everyone in Great Britain – you’ll be shaping the way we use and consume energy for generations to come.

**More Information**
--------------------

  

This role closes on **13th July at 23:59**, however we encourage candidates to submit their application as early as possible and not wait until the published closing date as this can vary.

  

We work towards the highest standards in everything we do, including how we support, value, and develop our people. Our aim is to encourage and support employees to thrive and be the best they can be. We celebrate the difference people can bring into our organisation, and welcome and encourage applicants with diverse experiences and backgrounds, and offer flexible and tailored support, at home and in the office.


We're committed to building a workforce that represents the communities we serve, and a working environment in which each individual feels valued, respected, fairly treated, and able to reach their full potential.

**About Choreograph: A Leading WPP Media Brand**
 Choreograph is WPP’s global data products and technology company. We’re on a mission to transform marketing by building the fastest, most connected data platform that bridges marketing strategy to scaled activation.
   

  

 We work with agencies and clients to transform the value of data by bringing together technology, data and analytics capabilities. We deliver this through the Open Media Studio, an AI\-enabled media and data platform for the next era of advertising.
   

  

 We’re endlessly curious. Our team of thinkers, builders, creators and problem solvers are over 1,000 strong, across 20 markets around the world.
   

  

**Role Summary And Impact**
 The Creative Optimisation product is a DCO (Dynamic Creative Optimization) application that is built and maintained in\-house at Choreograph, by the Optimization team.
   

  

 The product enables personalization of creative content at scale, across multiple channels such as digital display, mobile apps, CTV, YouTube, video and social.
   

  

 This is no start up. The application is already serving tens of millions of ads and terabytes’ worth of media, everyday in real\-time, across the globe.
   

  

 We are on the lookout for a Senior Data Scientist to join our team to co\-develop a step\-change feature: Algorithmic Content Opitmization (ACO). Our vision is to leverage data signals to algorithmically serve the most relevant creative to the right audience in the right moment that maximises performance, continuously.
   

  

 The role will report to VP Data Science and be part of a small (but growing!) team of Data Scientists. The ideal candidate will have a background in Reinforcement Learning (or related disciplines), with hands\-on cloud technology experience. Whilst commercial experience is highly desirable, given the deployment of RL at scale remains relatively nasant, we’re happy to consider candidates with academic research as well as commercial background.
   

  

 The candidate though does have to be truly, technically competent. For the scale and complexity at which our product operates, off\-the\-shelf solutions are often not fit\-for\-purpose. The ideal candidate has to have the ability to customise source code, add in new features and code from scratch.
   

  

 Whilst model deployment / software development experience is highly desirable, we do have a team of engineers to support so exposure in this space will be sufficient.
   

  

 Culture\-wise, we’re looking for a great team player who is passionate about applying Data Science techniques to solve complex problems and drive innovation.
   

  

 In return, you will get the opportunity to solve cutting\-edge problems and drive measurable performance improvement for our clients. Not to mention, working with a team of supportive, seasoned developers, product managers and data scientists who have successfully built and deployed scalable, global products.
   

  

  

  

 Key Responsibilities:
   

  

* Develop and optimize the ACO algorithm(s) and related Data Science components for the product
* Design and contribute to the end\-to\-end machine learning pipeline from data collection, reprocessing to model training, simulation, evaluation, deployment and experimentation / testing
* Implement and interpret explainability frameworks to provide clear insights into model decisions, ensuring transparency and compliance with WPP standards
* Collaborate with stakeholders to identify business needs and translate these requirements into technical solutions that are scalable and impactful
* Conduct rigorous model testing and validation to ensure robustness and accuracy
* Prepare detailed documentation and reports that communicate complex model behaviours, predictions, and insights in a manner accessible to both technical and non\-technical audiences
* Stay abreast of academic research and industry advancements in RL, plus AI/ML in general.
* Knowledge\-share and support the wider team and Data Science community to drive innovations based on your work


**Skills And Experience**
 At WPP Media, we believe in the power of our culture and our people. It’s what elevates us to deliver exceptional experiences for both our clients and each other. In this role it will be critical to embrace WPP \& WPP Media’s shared core values:
   

  

* Be Extraordinary by Leading Collectively to Inspire transformational Creativity.
* Create an Open environment by Balancing People and Client Experiences by Cultivating Trust.

At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.  

  

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we’re only just getting started.

**About the team**


We don’t build pricing models, we build the driving intelligence that feeds them. Our mission is to drive safer roads and fairer insurance through data.


The Telematics team transforms raw phone sensor data into meaningful insights about how people drive. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, we process high\-frequency data to extract behavioural signals that power our understanding of driving quality, context, and risk.

**About the Role**


As a Lead Data Scientist, you’ll drive the technical direction of our behavioural modelling work. You’ll lead the development of telematics features from idea to production, including exploratory analysis, signal design, risk evaluation, and scalable deployment.


This is a hands\-on leadership role where you’ll design solutions, mentor other scientists, influence architecture across systems, and guide decision\-making in uncertain or complex contexts.


We’re looking for an applied scientist \- someone who thrives on getting things into production, values strong engineering, and has opinions on building reliable, scalable systems.

**What you will be doing**

* + Drive the development of telematics features from mobile sensor data, including project design, modelling, validation, and deployment.

* + Conduct deep dives into driving signals, develop hypotheses, and evaluate their predictive power for risk.
	+ Design technical solutions with clear trade\-offs around performance, scalability, and maintainability.

* + Collaborate closely with data engineers, software engineers, mobile developers, and PMs to deliver production\-grade features.

* + Mentor data scientists, set high standards for technical quality, and promote knowledge sharing and learning.

* + Own delivery of large, complex projects, breaking them into milestones, planning collaboratively, and unblocking teams.

* + Contribute to Request For Comments (RFCs), design reviews, and technical discussions and initiatives with high technical ambiguity.

* + Ensure that our models and features are observable, tested, and continuously improving.

* + Help shape the team roadmap and longer\-term strategy for behavioural signal development.

**About You**

* + - MSc or equivalent industry experience in a relevant field (e.g. Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Statistics). A PhD is welcome but not required.

* + - Experience delivering production\-grade data science or engineering solutions, including design, implementation, and deployment

* + - Strong proficiency in Python and SQL, with practical experience in designing and implementing efficient data pipelines, including performance tuning and optimization.

* + - Proven ability to apply machine learning techniques to real\-world problems. Familiarity with core libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit\-learn, SciPy, and Polars is expected.

* + - Experience with digital signal processing, mobile sensor physics, or behavioural signal design.

* + - Proven track record of designing and delivering scalable data products, driving cross\-functional initiatives, and influencing architectural decisions.

* + - Strong communicator, skilled at translating between technical and non\-technical audiences, and building alignment.

* + - A growth mindset: open to feedback, committed to continuous learning, and eager to help others develop.


Nice to Have

* + Experience leading applied ML projects end\-to\-end, with a focus on code quality, runtime efficiency, and measurable impact.

* + Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS), containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes), and orchestration tools.

* + Experience mentoring and coaching other data scientists and setting technical direction in high\-impact domains.


Background in mobility, insurance, user behaviour modelling, or driver risk analytics.  

* +

 About Measure
 



  





 Measure is building the world’s first ethical and transparent human data marketplace.
 



  





 The world we live in is awash in data: what we watch and wear, who we know, what we do, and how we live our lives.

 Join a purpose driven winning team, committed to results, in an inclusive and high\-performing culture.
   

  

 The world is changing faster than ever and so are we!
   

  

 “Big data”, “machine learning” and “AI” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever\-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results\-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.
   

  

 Our goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage and govern stable high\-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk\-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day.
   

  

**What Are We Looking For?**
 We want talented pragmatic analytically oriented data scientists who are equally at home interpreting and applying statistics as they are ingesting and massaging data, translating regulatory requirements into models and explaining complex issues in simple concise ways. We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right – the first time – and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.
   

  

 To be a Manager in Forecasting arm of Retail Models \& Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you also need to be a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy data sets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important.
   

  

 We are results driven, we work hard, we play hard, we nerd out and we bring service, smiles and solutions to every problem that we face; so should you.
   

  

**Make an Impact**
 As a Manager, you will report directly to a Senior Manager or Director and be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of forecasting models and analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance – the regulatory capital (AIRB) models covering all of the Bank’s retail and small business product lines. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Provisioning, Model Operations, Finance, Collections, Model Validation and Governance, Technology \& Data, Compliance and Audit.
   

  

 You will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on\-premise GPU computing, open source Jupyter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.
   

  

 Under the guidance of your Director, your team of risk modeling experts will use these tools to develop advanced risk prediction and loss estimation forecasting models that will be used to make decisions worth $billions every month and therefore they need to be not only precise and accurate, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure and useful. You will be responsible for understanding the goals \& priorities set for you, executing them efficiently with a perpetual eye on quality, asking questions often and delivering results in harmony with your teammates.

 You thrive in cross\-functional teams, turning complex data into a shared language everyone can rally around.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.  

Yelp connects people with great local businesses. Our platform is powered by a vibrant community contributing reviews and engaging with local businesses daily. We monetize primarily through advertising, helping millions of businesses connect with high\-intent consumers. The Ads Auction system sits at the heart of this exchange, determining which ads are shown for every opportunity.  

The Ads Marketplace team is responsible for the core engine that drives Yelp's advertising business. We develop and optimize the sophisticated auction, bidding, and pacing systems that balance advertiser value (ROI), consumer experience, and Yelp's monetization goals. We work at the intersection of economics, machine learning, and large\-scale systems engineering.  

As the Lead Product Manager for Ads Auction and Measurement, you will own the product strategy and execution for Yelp's core ad auction, bidding, pricing, budget pacing mechanisms, and corresponding measurements. This is a highly technical leadership role where you will guide the evolution of algorithms and systems that make real\-time decisions maximizing value across multiple stakeholders. You will define how we measure the performance and impact of these complex systems, focusing on both short\-term efficiency and long\-term impact. You will partner closely with world\-class engineering and applied science teams to design, experiment, implement, and iterate on auction dynamics and the metrics that guide our progress.

* **Algorithm \& System Optimization:** Partner deeply with Engineering and Data Science to design, develop, and refine the auction\-based ad selection system. Translate advertiser goals (ROI, leads, conversions), user experience, and monetization considerations into algorithmic requirements, and prioritize initiatives based on concrete data and expected impact.
* **Auction Measurement \& Evaluation:** Define and own the key metrics framework for evaluating auction health, efficiency, and the business impact. Drive the development of robust measurement for complex trade\-offs (e.g., relevance vs. monetization, short\-term vs. long\-term effects). Design and interpret large\-scale A/B tests.
* **Independent Data Analysis:** Conduct hands\-on analysis of large\-scale auction and advertising datasets using tools like SQL and Python to uncover optimization opportunities, validate hypotheses, understand performance drivers, and inform product decisions.
* **Technical Product Development:** Lead the end\-to\-end product lifecycle for auction\-related features and improvements, from ideation and requirements definition through launch and iteration.
* **Cross\-Functional Leadership:** Serve as the product leader for the auction domain, collaborating effectively with Engineering, Data Science, Sales, Finance, and other Product teams. Communicate complex technical concepts and trade\-offs clearly to diverse audiences.
