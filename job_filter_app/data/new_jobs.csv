**Institute for Data, Process and Knowledge Management**  

Part\-time, 30 hours/week  

Starting October 01, 2025, and ending after 4 years

You want to deepen your interest in your research topic while gaining your first teaching experience? This position opens doors to either an academic career or a later switch to a career in business. We are looking for support in research and teaching at the Institute for Data, Process and Knowledge Management (https://www.wu.ac.at/en/dpkm) situated within the Department of Information Systems and Operations Management. In particular, the position opens the possibility to investigate and advance research on Digital Humanism, on the topic of communicating AI knowledge to a variety of stakeholders. This position is part of the Vienna Doctoral College on Digital Humanism (https://www.dighumcollege.at/). The position is advertised for 4 years.
What to expect


We are looking for candidates interested in performing a PhD on the topics of *Communicating AI: Knowledge Structures and Sensemaking Tools for Critical Engagement*. As AI systems become ubiquitous in many areas of life, including education and work, it is essential that they are better understood by a variety of stakeholders. This includes different types of end\-users in different areas, such as AI engineers that create those systems, managers that deal with the embedding of AI systems in their organizations, educators or trainers in various domains, or non\-expert audiences. For these, technical knowledge about AI technologies and related regulations (e.g., EU AI Act) is increasingly important. Such knowledge also includes critical reflection on and healthy skepticism towards the outputs of AI systems, including knowledge of limitations and biases.



A key challenge lies in how to efficiently and effectively equip these stakeholders to acquire (subsets of) the knowledge that they require for performing their various tasks. In this thesis, the aim is to explore various methods for AI knowledge communication and co\-production relying on formal knowledge representation (to represent different expertise levels) and advanced visual interactions. We will test the effectiveness of such methods with an explicit focus on critical evaluation. Through this we aim to foster critical interaction with AI systems and a better understanding of human agency when working with AI.

 Zalando fulfills more than a hundred million customer orders every year and volumes are increasing. Transport within Zalando builds and operates systems that are at the core of Zalando’s platform strategy and ensure timely, efficient, and correct delivery of every one of our customers’ 185\+ million orders and shipments every year.
   

  

 Enabling the fulfillment of orders is a complex process, involving the choice of physical locations of our warehouses to our Hubs This is the backbone of logistics where movements occur. Efficient network routing and capacity planning optimise utilise (e.g., trucks, linehauls) and reduce transit times, directly impacting service levels and cost per unit transported. Notably, the middle mile is closely steered by the requirements of the last mile — meaning last mile delivery demands often dictate middle mile scheduling and consolidation decisions. This makes integrated planning between the two critical for transport network efficiency.
   

  

 The last mile is often the most complex and expensive segment. Smart planning here, including optimal route design and delivery slot management, is crucial for meeting customer expectations on speed and reliability while keeping delivery costs manageable. Since the last mile drives the timing and structuring of middle\-mile operations, its importance in the overall transport domain is amplified.
   

  

 As a
 **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** 
 , you will be essential in defining and managing the next generation of our engineering infrastructure (e.g. data ETL pipelines, train/inference deep learning model pipelines, and many more). You will be part of a skilled team of data engineers and ML engineers address complex transport network and planning challenges, improve the optimisation of the network, and supporting many highly important strategic and data\-driven use\-cases, such as network design simulation and optimisation, dynamic slot and carrier recommendation, and simulation for disruption management.

**Rejection of mediocrity \& high performance**
* Give direct feedback to everyone immediately \- rather than avoiding unpopularity, expecting things to improve naturally, or trading short\-term pain for extreme long\-term pain.

* Don’t quit \- push to the final outcome, despite any barriers.

* Collaborate on Product Strategy: Act as a strategic partner to Product Managers and Engineers. Gather and analyse user feedback, identifying their information needs. Your analysis and insights will be critical in identifying new opportunities and shaping the future direction of our search and discovery products.

* A proven track record of working on search relevance, ranking, query understanding or solving closely\-related NLP problems.
* Demonstrable, hands\-on experience building, fine\-tuning, and evaluating a range of language models for specific tasks like classification, NER, and semantic similarity.
* Experience in experimental design and statistical analysis. Expertise in creating evaluation datasets and developing relevance guidelines. You know how to ask the right questions and how to design experiments that provide clear, statistically significant answers.
* A talent for structuring ambiguous problems and applying logical reasoning, translating complex challenges into clear, actionable plans.
* High proficiency in Python and data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit\-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Hugging Face) and familiarity with SQL or other query languages.
* The ability to distill complex findings into clear, concise insights for diverse audiences, from engineers to executives. You are a collaborator by nature.



  





 Bonus Points:
 


* Direct experience in the financial services or financial data industry.

 We're making Africa the first cashless continent.
   

  

 In 2017, over half the population in Sub\-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.
   

  

 We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer\-to\-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.
   

  

 Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...
   

  

****How you’ll help us achieve it****
 Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we’re still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people’s everyday lives.
   

  

 We’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist and help grow and strengthen our user base. You’ll work on high\-impact use cases with millions of users, such as optimizing our existing scratch card rewards program or designing and launching entirely new initiatives from scratch.
   

  

 The technical challenges range from crafting simple heuristics when data is sparse to applying advanced techniques like geospatial analytics, network analysis, and uplift modeling. You’ll own the full cycle: defining the right approach, implementing it, and shipping it in production.
   

  

 This role is highly experimentation\-driven: you’ll be able to rapidly test ideas, learn from real user feedback, and iterate quickly.
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who is product\-minded, hands\-on, and pragmatic: a data scientist who sees beyond models and algorithms and thinks deeply about how data connects to intuitive user behavior and real\-world impact.
   

  

**In This Role You’ll**
* Be part of a multidisciplinary team, working with engineers, data analysts, economists and a product manager.
* Focus on advanced analytics and machine learning problems, delivering them end\-to\-end independently.
* Prioritise work and shape your own approach in a way that maximises the positive impact on both users and the business.
* Engage not just with business metrics, but also collaborate closely with Operations teams to understand the real\-world outcomes and impact of your work.


****Key Details****
* You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC \-5 and \+2\) with reliable Internet access.
* Wave covers travel once per year to one of our operating countries in Africa, as well as a yearly stipend of $1,200 to meet with coworkers.
* Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level and location, we offer a salary of up to $149,200 USD (paid in your local currency equivalent), plus a generous equity package.
* Major benefits:
+ Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).
+ 6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.
+ Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 21\-30 days exclusive of statutory holidays.
+ $10,000 annual charitable donation matching.


****Requirements****
* Education and Experience
+ Minimum Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or a related discipline. A Master's or PhD is a plus.

Relay is an e\-commerce\-native logistics network built from the ground up for environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Our mission is to reduce the number of miles driven per parcel, lower carbon emissions, and reduce delivery costs — all while reinvesting into local communities.

**About the role**
------------------


As a highly operational business, we rely on data science to power every part of our network. From day one, we’ve built Relay around a deep understanding of our supply chain, using our best\-in\-class data assets to set strategy, improve quality, and optimise performance across every layer of the network. Our high\-impact data team works across forecasting, optimisation, pricing, geospatial modelling, infrastructure planning, and more. Whether it’s planning courier capacity, guiding pitstop expansion, or improving the economics of delivery, our work directly shapes how Relay scales.


We are looking for Senior Data Scientists to join our growing data team; these are hands\-on roles with wide scope and strong exposure to decision\-making. You’ll partner closely with operations, product, and commercial teams to solve practical problems with real\-world impact, often working from messy datasets and complex systems, where the answers don’t sit neatly in one model. You’ll be embedded in cross\-functional teams, helping drive cost, quality, and reliability across the network. If you’re motivated by fast feedback loops, strong ownership, with strong exposure to leadership, and the chance to shape a growing system from the inside out, we’d love to hear from you.

**Open Roles**
--------------

### **Senior Data Scientist \- Relay Network**


The Network Data Science team is responsible for modelling, forecasting, and optimising how parcels, couriers, and costs flow through Relay’s delivery network. We work across the business to guide operational decisions, shape commercial strategy, and ensure the network scales sustainably. Example projects include:

* Forecasting parcel volumes at multiple horizons to inform hiring, shift allocation, pitstop scaling, and pricing
* Building operational and financial models to simulate trade\-offs between cost, quality, and growth across the network
* Structuring fragmented datasets into usable insight using AI and programmatic approaches
* Embedding forecasting and planning models into live tooling used by operators, analysts, and finance teams
* Supporting strategic planning for new zone launches, infrastructure investment, and client expansion
* Acting as a thought partner to operations, commercial, and finance leads to bring a scientific lens to high\-stakes planning and investment decisions

### **Senior Data Scientist \- Attribution \& Explainability**


The Attribution \& Explainability team acts as Relay’s internal detective squad, uncovering hidden inefficiencies, guiding smarter decisions, and driving meaningful impact across the business. Positioned at the centre of Relay’s operations, we partner with teams across logistics, finance, commercial, and beyond to bring clarity to complex problems and identify opportunities for improvement.


Our work helps illuminate which parts of the network are operating effectively and where bottlenecks, losses, or misalignments are occurring. Example projects include:

* Developing frameworks to identify where parcels are delayed or lost in the network, and designing interventions to resolve these bottlenecks
* Modelling the impact of future network expansion on operational constraints, helping to shape Relay’s long\-term growth strategy
* Analysing marketplace dynamics to better understand the cost structures and incentives for last\-mile couriers
* Collaborating with the broader data team to build forecasting models that inform high\-level strategic planning
* Acting as a thought partner to operations, commercial, and finance leads, bringing a scientific, data\-driven perspective to critical planning and investment decisions

**You Will Thrive in This Role If You:**
----------------------------------------

* 6\+ years of experience in data science, with a strong record of delivering models into production
* Deep experience with Python and SQL
* Strong foundations in statistics and probability, with experience applying them in operational and/or financial contexts
* Comfort working in ambiguity and navigating messy or incomplete data
* Effective communication skills — you can explain technical results clearly to non\-technical audiences
* Comfortable having strategic conversations with senior stakeholders, working across functions and disciplines to drive impact

**Nice to haves**
-----------------

* Experience working in logistics, marketplaces, or similarly complex operational businesses
* Experience using LLMs or AI tools to structure and extract meaning from unstructured data
* Experience automating workflows and deploying model pipelines (e.g. MLFlow, GCP Vertex, Airflow, dbt or similar)
* Exposure to business planning, pricing, or commercial decision\-making
* Familiarity with geospatial data
* Experience in fast\-scaling startups or operational teams

  

We're flexible on experience – if you’re an experienced and pragmatic data scientist, with a track record of driving impact, we’d love to hear from you.

Job Details
We are looking for an experienced Lead Data Engineer to join our team in Reading / London!
The key focus of this role is creating, maintaining and evolving a key set of feed applications which improve quality and quantity of the numerous (\>50\) “consumer panels” which Kantar operates around the globe.
A consumer panel is a group of users who have volunteered to answer online surveys. These users are “opted in” with all relevant permissions already provided, and have filled out demographic questionnaires. This allows Kantar to send them relevant online surveys.
In recent years, the Market Research industry has been an increasing target of online fraud. This means that in some markets where surveys are incentivised (typically economically eg. small payments per survey completed which may be converted to gift cards etc), fraudsters are targeting survey panels and completing surveys to obtain financial incentives. As with any sophisticated and scaled fraud attacks, the attacks are constantly evolving.
At Kantar, we need to protect against these kinds of fraud attacks (both existing patterns and novel attacks) and constantly ensure that we are able to detect and remove any fraudulent panellists. We already have a range of methods in production to provide protection, however, we believe that we need to stay ahead of the evolving fraud and invest in this area so we can always provide the best data and the best answers for our customers globally.

### **Job summary**


The government has set out an ambition to raise the growth rate of the UK economy. The UK has larger geographical differences than many other developed countries on multiple measures, including productivity, pay, educational attainment and health. Reducing these disparities will be a vital component in ensuring that every part of our country is better off. This role is responsible for providing spatial analysis to inform policy decisions that can help achieve this aim.


We are seeking a senior analyst to lead the Strategic Spatial Analysis team. The team currently acts as the government’s economic think tank on spatial issues. It is responsible for producing spatial analysis and thought leadership, advocating for a place\-based perspective within government and acting as a critical facilitator between teams. In a DBT context, this means analysing growth through a spatial lens. As our team priorities continue to evolve, the successful candidate will have the unique opportunity to influence and shape the future direction of our projects.


Given the strategic nature of this role, this post is guaranteed to be interesting and wide\-ranging. The post\-holder will work closely with analysts across DBT and OGDs, policy colleagues and external stakeholders (including Mayoral Strategic Authorities). They will be expected to work flexibly across the wider team to meet business priorities and develop a greater knowledge of spatial analysis, competences in analytical techniques, and written and oral communication skills.


This role will be responsible for developing analytical insights and building the strategic evidence base relating to local economic growth, as well as the broader role of ‘place’ in government policy.


As a manager, you’ll guide a team of analysts, fostering a supportive environment that values diverse perspectives and backgrounds. As a leader in our team, you’ll inspire innovation, champion inclusivity, and foster external engagement and collaboration with DBT and OGD analysts, sector teams, place\-based teams and policy colleagues. Your influence will support positive change in communities across the UK.


Please note that the scope and responsibilities of this role within the team may be subject to change as ministerial priorities evolve. Therefore, post holders will need to be agile and flexible to meet any emerging needs.

### **Job description**


This role will be responsible for developing analytical insights and building the strategic evidence base relating to local economic growth and the role of cities in boosting and spreading prosperity, as well as the role of ‘place’ in government policy.


It will involve understanding and advising senior officials and Ministers on the role cities and sectors play in productivity growth, as well as advocating for the importance of recognising how geographical location impacts diagnoses and industrial policy development.


The postholder will be responsible for developing analytical insights with the help of a small team (Three G7 and two SEOs) and will have a key role to play in shaping a high\-profile policy agenda, with key responsibilities including:

* Evaluating the effectiveness of DBT policy levers and contributing to the design of policies will be essential. We envision the team and this role providing the expertise needed to actively shape activities across the Department, ensuring the delivery of DBT place objectives, including:
	+ Industrial Strategy: Lead the examination of the economic potential of different places, develop an evidence base, and assess growth constraints and key drivers;
	+ Local Employment: Oversee the analysis of job creation and sustainability, work with local actors, and analyse skill demands and major employment trends;
	+ Providing consultancy advice on spatial issues for the department.
### **Person specification**

**Skills \& Experience required.**

* Experience in place\-based economic analysis.

**Essential criteria**


The below criteria are essential and will be assessed at application stage;

* Proven experience in spatial economic analysis and policy development

 In the future, almost everything we consume will simply materialise on our doorsteps – what we call “e\-commerce” today will simply be “commerce” tomorrow. But if we continue on today’s trajectory, the growth of e\-commerce risks damaging the environment, alienating our communities, and straining the bottom\-line for small businesses.
   

  

 Relay is an e\-commerce\-native logistics network built from the ground up for environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Our mission is to reduce the number of miles driven per parcel, lower carbon emissions, and reduce delivery costs — all while reinvesting into local communities.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a highly operational business, we rely on data science to power every part of our network. From day one, we’ve built Relay around a deep understanding of our supply chain, using our best\-in\-class data assets to set strategy, improve quality, and optimise performance across every layer of the network. Our high\-impact data team works across forecasting, optimisation, pricing, geospatial modelling, infrastructure planning, and more. Whether it’s planning courier capacity, guiding pitstop expansion, or improving the economics of delivery, our work directly shapes how Relay scales.
   

  

 We are looking for Senior Data Scientists to join our growing data team; these are hands\-on roles with wide scope and strong exposure to decision\-making. You’ll partner closely with operations, product, and commercial teams to solve practical problems with real\-world impact, often working from messy datasets and complex systems, where the answers don’t sit neatly in one model. You’ll be embedded in cross\-functional teams, helping drive cost, quality, and reliability across the network. If you’re motivated by fast feedback loops, strong ownership, with strong exposure to leadership, and the chance to shape a growing system from the inside out, we’d love to hear from you.
   

  

**Open Roles**
**Senior Data Scientist \- Relay Network**
 The Network Data Science team is responsible for modelling, forecasting, and optimising how parcels, couriers, and costs flow through Relay’s delivery network. We work across the business to guide operational decisions, shape commercial strategy, and ensure the network scales sustainably. Example projects include:
   

  

* Forecasting parcel volumes at multiple horizons to inform hiring, shift allocation, pitstop scaling, and pricing
* Building operational and financial models to simulate trade\-offs between cost, quality, and growth across the network
* Structuring fragmented datasets into usable insight using AI and programmatic approaches
* Embedding forecasting and planning models into live tooling used by operators, analysts, and finance teams
* Supporting strategic planning for new zone launches, infrastructure investment, and client expansion
* Acting as a thought partner to operations, commercial, and finance leads to bring a scientific lens to high\-stakes planning and investment decisions


**Senior Data Scientist \- Attribution \& Explainability**
 The Attribution \& Explainability team acts as Relay’s internal detective squad, uncovering hidden inefficiencies, guiding smarter decisions, and driving meaningful impact across the business. Positioned at the centre of Relay’s operations, we partner with teams across logistics, finance, commercial, and beyond to bring clarity to complex problems and identify opportunities for improvement.
   

  

 Our work helps illuminate which parts of the network are operating effectively and where bottlenecks, losses, or misalignments are occurring. Example projects include:
   

  

* Developing frameworks to identify where parcels are delayed or lost in the network, and designing interventions to resolve these bottlenecks
* Modelling the impact of future network expansion on operational constraints, helping to shape Relay’s long\-term growth strategy
* Analysing marketplace dynamics to better understand the cost structures and incentives for last\-mile couriers
* Collaborating with the broader data team to build forecasting models that inform high\-level strategic planning
* Acting as a thought partner to operations, commercial, and finance leads, bringing a scientific, data\-driven perspective to critical planning and investment decisions


**You Will Thrive in This Role If You:**
* 6\+ years of experience in data science, with a strong record of delivering models into production
* Deep experience with Python and SQL
* Strong foundations in statistics and probability, with experience applying them in operational and/or financial contexts
* Comfort working in ambiguity and navigating messy or incomplete data
* Effective communication skills — you can explain technical results clearly to non\-technical audiences
* Comfortable having strategic conversations with senior stakeholders, working across functions and disciplines to drive impact


**Nice to haves**
* Experience working in logistics, marketplaces, or similarly complex operational businesses
* Experience using LLMs or AI tools to structure and extract meaning from unstructured data
* Experience automating workflows and deploying model pipelines (e.g. MLFlow, GCP Vertex, Airflow, dbt or similar)
* Exposure to business planning, pricing, or commercial decision\-making
* Familiarity with geospatial data
* Experience in fast\-scaling startups or operational teams


 We're flexible on experience – if you’re an experienced and pragmatic data scientist, with a track record of driving impact, we’d love to hear from you.

 Join a purpose driven winning team, committed to results, in an inclusive and high\-performing culture.
   

  

 The world is changing faster than ever and so are we!
   

  

 “Big data”, “machine learning” and “AI” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever\-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results\-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.
   

  

 Our goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage and govern stable high\-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk\-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $billions safe every single day.
   

  

**What Are We Looking For?**
 We want talented pragmatic analytically oriented data scientists who are equally at home interpreting and applying statistics as they are ingesting and massaging data, translating regulatory requirements into models and explaining complex issues in simple concise ways. We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right – the first time – and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.
   

  

 To be a Manager in Forecasting arm of Retail Models \& Analytics, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you also need to be a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy data sets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important.
   

  

 We are results driven, we work hard, we play hard, we nerd out and we bring service, smiles and solutions to every problem that we face; so should you.
   

  

**Make an Impact**
 As a Manager, you will report directly to a Senior Manager or Director and be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of forecasting models and analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance – the regulatory capital (AIRB) models covering all of the Bank’s retail and small business product lines. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners including Provisioning, Model Operations, Finance, Collections, Model Validation and Governance, Technology \& Data, Compliance and Audit.
   

  

 You will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on\-premise GPU computing, open source Jupyter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.
   

  

 Under the guidance of your Director, your team of risk modeling experts will use these tools to develop advanced risk prediction and loss estimation forecasting models that will be used to make decisions worth $billions every month and therefore they need to be not only precise and accurate, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure and useful. You will be responsible for understanding the goals \& priorities set for you, executing them efficiently with a perpetual eye on quality, asking questions often and delivering results in harmony with your teammates.

* You relish the opportunity and yet also understand the responsibility and weight that comes with the fact that the output of your models will directly influence the bank’s financial statements
* You can read complex and lengthy regulatory requirements and identify opportunities for optimization while always remaining committed to compliance excellence
* You understand what PDs, LGDs, EADs \& RWA really are, from the ground up, and can model them precisely for any product

* Accurately estimate impacts and implement the models developed, recalibrated and maintained in production platforms
* Identify, promote and lead process improvements for model development and monitoring
* Ensure that the data used for model development is reliable and robust and that it adheres to industry and regulatory standards


**Do you have the skills that will enable you to succeed in this role? \- We'd love to work with you if you have**
* Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering or an equivalent technical field
* A demonstrated history of analytic problem solving and sound judgment
* Experience as an analyst or data scientist with a track record of accomplishments working on cross\-functional teams
* Strong English\-language verbal and written communications skills: the ability to distill abstract business requirements into analysis, concisely convey technical outcomes, tell a story visually with data, prepare and edit high\-quality documentation and be accepted as a trusted advisor by peers

Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business\-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C\-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).*
*The benefit of being a digital\-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.*
*I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""*
**How You Will Make An Impact**
* Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
* Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
* Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
* Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency


**Preferred Experience**
* Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
* 1\-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
* High level of comfort with SQL or Python


**Who You Are**
* You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles

**What is the opportunity?**
 RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from NLP\-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

* Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility \& stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
* Research \& Development: You will read research papers (established work and state\-of\-the\-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real\-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
* IT: You will collaborate with cross\-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best\-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
* Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.

* Strong communication and interpersonal skills
* Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field
* Proficient programming skills in Python or a similar language; you should already be comfortable with writing research experiments and be willing to learn how to write clean code.
* Familiarity with popular machine learning frameworks and libraries


**Nice\-to\-have**
* A risk\-oriented mindset: You are curious about the “how” as well as the “why""
* Publication or prior research experience (applied or fundamental)
* Experience with version control systems
* Comfortable with command line tools


**What’s in it for you?**

We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.
   

  

**Flex Time**
 Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John’s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.

 To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset – the employee.
   

  

 The Purpose Of The IBA Is To Provide Attractive Benefits To All Full\-time Employees Of Northstrat On a Flexible Basis That Enables Each Covered Employee To Select a Package That Best Suits His Or Her Needs. Whether Those Needs Are Paid Time Off, Medical Expenses, Prescription Drug Expenses, Cash Disbursement, Or a Combination Of Any Of These, The IBA Provides Flexibility To Help You Meet Your Specific Goals. The IBA Can Be Used For Such Things As:
   

  

 IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.
   

  

**Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)**
 The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.
   

  

**Stock Options**
 Because Northstrat is an employee\-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.
   

  

**Lifelong Learning**
 Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work\-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.
