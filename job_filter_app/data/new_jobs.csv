**More About Hopper**
 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
   

  

 Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   

  

 Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1\.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
   

  

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.
   

  

 Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest\-growing mobile\-first travel marketplace.

**More About Hopper**
 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
   

  

 Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   

  

 Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1\.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
   

  

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.

Working at Stotles

**About this Role \& Why We're Hiring**
---------------------------------------

**It's never been a more exciting time at Stotles. Here's why we're looking for you.**

**Our data is the foundation of our product, our growth, and the value we deliver**. As we scale, it’s not enough to have the most complete, highest quality data in the market — **we need to make that data as useful as possible**. **As part of our Data \& Platform Team**, you’ll lead the charge in pushing the boundary of what’s possible. **You’ll not only drive the breadth, depth, and quality of our data, but you’ll also harness AI to make it faster, smarter, and easier to use.** Your work will transform complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that empower our users to move quickly and make confident decisions. This is about more than accuracy. It’s about impact. It’s about shaping how users experience our product — turning raw information into answers, signals, and next steps. **You’ll help us stay ahead by building data that’s not just reliable, but radically useful**.

**The ideal candidate is a curious, analytical problem\-solver with a passion for building and improving data systems that power real\-world AI tools**. You understand that small, continuous improvements can dramatically enhance system performance, user experience, and product quality over time. You’ll take a hands\-on, proactive approach to developing algorithms, shaping AI\-driven workflows, and streamlining processes that raise the bar for our data quality, coverage, and scalability. Your attention to detail, combined with a rigorous, scientific mindset, will help us measure, monitor, and continuously improve the systems that underpin our platform. **A willingness to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty is essential**—you won’t just plan solutions, you’ll build them, test them, and deliver outcomes that matter.


In this role, **you’ll work at the heart of the Data \& Platform Team** **and closely collaborate with our Product Lead, Engineers, Chief Product Officer (CPO), and Chief Technical Officer (CTO) to tackle the exciting challenge of scaling our AI capabilities, platform, and operations.** Together, you’ll ensure our AI\-powered tools set the standard for quality, reliability, and impact—helping the product team deliver an exceptional, trusted platform for public sector insights.

**Comp Range: £50,000 \- £70,000 dependent on experience, plus equity**

**What You'll Do**
------------------

* Design and implement algorithms, models, and workflows to improve, enrich, and unify our core data assets. You’ll help us build smarter, more connected datasets that power our products.
* Proactively explore and evaluate new data sources with a sharp focus on their potential product and market value. You’ll assess how these datasets can strengthen our AI tools, improve user outcomes, and unlock new growth opportunities \- balancing data quality, collection methods, and commercial impact.
* Work with product managers, engineers, and the commercial team to ship, measure, and improve our AI\-driven tools. You’ll design evaluation frameworks, monitor system performance, and use insights to continuously improve outcomes through prompt engineering, system design, and optimisation.
* Autonomously create, manage and improve efficiency of key processes to clean \& enrich Stotles data by pushing towards automation and decreasing workload for engineers \& dependence on external vendors.
* Build and maintain structured processes to track Stotles data quality and coverage, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.
* Partner with teams across the business to ensure our data and AI capabilities support Stotles expansion in new geographies \& verticals

**Who We're Looking For**
-------------------------

* **Experience**


	+ A bachelor’s degree in a technical or analytical field (e.g., STEM, economics, finance, etc.) is helpful, but not required
	+ At least two years of experience working hands\-on with complex data analytics/science are a must\-have
	+ Experience working in a fast\-paced professional work environment where analytical thinking \& rigorous organisation were required \- e.g. high growing tech start\-up, consulting (the list can be longer) \- is highly valued
	+ Proven experience analysing, improving, or working with data in a real production environment \- where your work directly informed business decisions and made a tangible impact on your organisation \- is appreciated
* **Mentality**


	+ Likes to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. “Our job isn’t done until *the* job is done”
	+ Ready to tackle the last mile when needed, and motivated by taking on challenges that stretch your personal capability
	+ Open to feedback and happy to collaborate. Aristotle said ‘the whole is greater than the sum of it’s parts’. That’s how we work!
	+ Unafraid to say, ""I don't know the answer. But I have a few ideas on how we can find out"".
* **Methods**


	+ Analytical: you are able to search for patterns based on qualitative/quantitative insights and identify the causes for the pattern
	+ Highly organised: you have a high attention to detail and don’t let things fall through the cracks.
	+ Data\-driven and outcome\-focused: you can track, interpret and evaluate outcomes to show impact.
	+ Pragmatic: capable of focusing on the highest priorities and apply the 80/20 rule to achieve them (i.e. what 20% of the work will drive 80% of the impact?).
* **Skills**


	+ Highly proficient English (written and spoken)
	+ Proficient in querying \& manipulating data with SQL
	+ Hands\-on\-experience with Python for working with data
	+ Proven ability to analyse and interpret data and evidence to inform business decisions

We are ambitious and have a bold vision of what we want to achieve \- shaping ourselves into one of the best universities in the world, which we are achieving through the talents and endeavour of every employee.


Our culture empowers people to achieve this aim and to collectively, and individually, make a real difference.

**The role**


We are seeking qualified applicants for a position as Language Data Scientist on the ERC Synergy grant ‘NILOMORPH: The evolution of suprasegmental morphology in West Nilotic’, led by Matthew Baerman. The successful candidate will perform a key role in managing, processing and analyzing language data generated across the multiple teams that make up the project. The position is based at the Surrey Morphology Group at the University of Surrey, in Guildford, UK, and provides the opportunity to work in the vibrant and highly collegial research environment for which the SMG is renowned.

**Background**


The NILOMORPH project aims to reconstruct the morphological evolution of the West Nilotic languages, spoken primarily in South Sudan and neighboring countries. These languages have developed some of the most remarkable morphological systems on the planet, where simultaneous manipulation of multiple phonological features (vowel length, vowel height, tone, phonation type) results in enormous paradigms marked solely by the modulation of vowel properties.


The NILOMORPH combines fieldwork, experimental methods, and historical linguistics to account for the phonological, morphological and psycholinguistic pathways that led to this unique outcome. The project is spread across multiple teams, based in the UK, France, Germany and the USA, and will make use of a diverse range of language data taken from multiple sources: ongoing fieldwork, previous studies, text corpora and newly\-generated reconstructions, as well as well as the results of computational simulations and artificial language learning experiments.

**Responsiblities**


The successful candidate will develop and execute a set of data management and analysis tools will enable the diverse international team of researchers to create, access and manipulate the language data that is central to the NILOMORPH project.


 As a core member of the Surrey\-based team, the successful candidate will provide expert guidance on methods and tools for data analysis, including data design, data management protocols and statistical analysis. They will collaborate closely in the writing and dissemination of papers and presentations, and be expected to take initiative in the formulation of the research agenda.


 They will also participate in the broader activities both of the NILOMORPH group and of the Surrey Morphology Group (SMG). The candidate will have opportunities at SMG to develop their research leadership profile while interacting with world\-class researchers.

**About you**


Suitable candidates with a background in linguistics (or linguistics\-adjacent fields) are strongly encouraged to apply. Please refer to the full , under ‘Addendum’ for essential and desirable criteria.

**How to apply**


The following documents will be required:

* CV
* Contact details for 2 academic/industry referees.
* Three relevant works of research (DOI/URL links if possible).
* Research statement of one page, describing research interests and experience, and how you think this makes you suitable for the advertised post.
* A completed application form


Interviews are planned for 02 September 2025 and will be held online. Please contact Matthew Baerman m.baerman@surrey.ac.uk with any questions.

 **About the business division**  

The Water Utilities Division is Mott MacDonald’s centre of excellence for responding to the UK and Ireland's water and wastewater challenges. The work we do is at the forefront of ensuring safe water supplies for future generations, preventing urban flooding, and improving the health of our rivers and coastal environments.

We are market leaders in providing strategic water resources planning services to water companies, regional groups (including Water Resources South East and Water Resources East), regulators and the government in the UK as well as supporting our global business delivering water resources planning services internationally.

At Mott MacDonald you will have control of your own career path and great prospects for career progression as the business continues to grow. We can offer you development in technical, management or client\-facing directions.

 BACKGROUND
   

  

 Michabo Health Science Limited is an expanding spin\-out company from the University of Birmingham. We are leaders in the innovation and application of molecular toxicity data from 'omics technologies to support the hazard assessment of chemicals under European safety legislation. Our mission is to accelerate the world's transition towards safer chemicals without vertebrate animal testing, using molecular toxicity data to identify and characterise exposure\-related hazards for regulatory approval.
   

  

 As interest and confidence in applying metabolomics and transcriptomics technologies to regulatory toxicology grows, so we are growing. We now seek to recruit a skilled Omics Data Scientist, complementing the strengths of our existing team. We succeed because of the strength of our science, our people, and our collaborative approach to working with our clients, who include regulators and chemical companies throughout the UK and Europe, as well as the European Commission. Our core values include fostering teamwork, and earning trust in the approach to our mission through all that we do. We operate hybrid working, with the city of Birmingham, UK, serving as our physical meeting hub.
   

  

 THE ROLE
   

  

 A company Scientist role powers the delivery of our projects by conducting and delivering on contract research, assisting in the development of new contract proposals, and contributing to exploratory research in the company's R\&D programme. The Scientist works closely with Senior Scientists to conduct investigations and report scientific findings. We provide built\-in career progression for Scientists through the learning and development of project planning and management skills, and by specialising in methods continually being improved by our R\&D to solve real\-world challenges in chemical safety. Our Scientists also co\-author research publications.
   

  

 We seek a proven researcher and team player who speaks our language, the language of 'omics and 'omics data analysis, applied to human or animal biology. Applicants should have a PhD (or equivalent level of expertise) focused on applying metabolomics (primarily) or transcriptomics to either toxicology, human health/disease or perturbation biology. The Scientist will be capable of performing reproducible computational and/or statistical analyses of 'omics data to address toxicological questions, applying their knowledge of R or Python. They will review and incorporate insights from relevant scientific literature and databases to enable data analysis decisions and toxicological interpretation.
   

  

 Applicants should be motivated to apply their skills towards 21st century regulatory toxicology to help transition towards non\-animal toxicity testing. Some knowledge of mechanistic or regulatory toxicology is highly desirable, as is experience working outside of academia. We also invite applications from more experienced candidates for consideration in a more senior role in the company.

We constantly gather feedback to shape, prioritize, and launch the products they truly need. That's what makes Roofr's CRM special. We started by building essential sales tools like aerial roof measurements and digital sales proposals. But when our customers asked for a simple, affordable way to manage and scale their entire businesses, we listened. So, we created a CRM that connects these solutions—along with payments, material ordering, and more—into a seamless, powerful platform. With a clear roadmap ahead, we're excited to continue expanding and leading the market with innovative products.



We have an amazing culture, strong financials, and best\-in\-class company metrics. It's an exciting time to be part of an extraordinary startup that is already successful, yet still early enough to offer its team significant growth, equity, and the opportunity to make a real impact.


Building a powerful user experience is what sets Roofr apart from all other roofing platforms. As an Engineer in an early stage and high growth company, you'll play a critical role in turning raw data into insights that shape product decisions, drive strategy, and improve the customer experience. You'll have a direct impact on how we use data to grow, and help influence the roadmap for how analytics evolves at Roofr.



We're looking for a hands on Data Analytics Manager to lead and scale our growing data function across data engineering, analytics, and data science. This is a hands\-on leadership role for someone excited to define and execute a modern data strategy in a high\-growth environment.

* Collaborate with stakeholders to define KPIs, build dashboards, and provide strategic insights.
* Drive data governance, quality, documentation, and metric standardization.
* Guide the development of data products and experimentation frameworks (A/B testing, churn prediction, etc.).
* Partner with leadership to align data strategy with business objectives.
* Stay up to date on modern data tooling and recommend improvements to scale infrastructure and processes.

### **What You'll Bring**


* 5\+ years of experience in data roles, with at least 1–2 years managing a technical team.
* Strong technical skills in SQL, DBT, and orchestration tools like Airflow.
* Experience with modern data stacks (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery) and ELT tools (Stitch, Fivetran, Airbyte).
* Proficiency in data visualization and BI tools (Metabase, Sigma, Looker, or similar).
* Familiarity with Python or R for scripting and data science workflows.
* Solid understanding of experimentation, forecasting, and statistical analysis.
* Proven ability to drive cross\-functional alignment and communicate clearly with technical and non\-technical stakeholders.
* Passionate about building clean, scalable data infrastructure and enabling data\-driven decisions.

### **Bonus Points**


* Experience in a startup or high\-growth environment
* Exposure to customer or product analytics
* Experience designing data team org structures and hiring
* Knowledge of dbt Cloud and CI/CD for analytics engineering

### **Who You Are**


* **Curious**: You ask ""why"" often and dig deep to find the real story behind the data.

**Job Description**

**What is the opportunity?**


RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from NLP\-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.


The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

**What will you do?**

* **Application**: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions.
* **Validation**: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility \& stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
* **Research \& Development**: You will read research papers (established work and state\-of\-the\-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real\-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
* **IT**: You will collaborate with cross\-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best\-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
* **Governance**: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.


As a Senior Data Scientist, your technical expertise will enable you to be effective in a team environment and when working independently.

**What do you need to succeed?**

**Must\-have**

* Passionate about learning and staying up\-to\-date with research and technology
* Strong communication and interpersonal skills
* Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field
* 3\+ years programming skills experience in Python or a similar language; you should already be comfortable with writing research experiments and be willing to learn how to write clean code.
* Familiarity with popular machine learning frameworks and libraries

**Nice\-to\-have**

* A risk\-oriented mindset: You are curious about the “how” as well as the “why""
* Publication or prior research experience (applied or fundamental)
* Experience with version control systems
* Comfortable with command line tools

**What’s in it for you?**


As a team, we thrive on the challenge to be our best, encourage progressive thinking for continued growth, and collaborate with one another to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and our communities prosper. We respect and care about all of our team members and support one another in reaching our fullest potential. We work together to make a difference in our communities and to achieve success that is mutual.


This opportunity will provide you with:

* Leaders who support your development through coaching and managing opportunities
* Flexibility to work on projects that you are passionate about
* Ability to make a difference and lasting impact
* Work in a dynamic, collaborative, progressive, and high\-performing team
* Opportunities to do challenging work and make a difference

**What we’re looking for**


* A strong foundation in data science, statistics, or a related quantitative field
* A background in social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology) or statistics with experience applying that lens to human or behavioural data
* Experience building and refining algorithms, recommendation systems, or predictive models

* Experience producing decision\-making tools—like research memos, behavioural deep dives, or experiment reports
* Experience assisting with discovery and roadmapping alongside product and engineering teams
* Curiosity, empathy, and a passion for understanding what drives people’s decisions

* Produce human\-readable research reports and concise data briefs for internal stakeholders, focusing on actionable insights that inform strategic decisions.
* Create visualizations and dashboards that track usage trends, behaviour clusters, and performance of algorithmic features
* Support product iteration with both quantitative findings and qualitative insights from user data
* Think outside the box, how can we leverage the latest trends and technology to improve our products and increase time to value

  


**What we’re looking for**


* A strong foundation in data science, statistics, or a related quantitative field
* A background in social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology) or statistics with experience applying that lens to human or behavioural data
* Experience building and refining algorithms, recommendation systems, or predictive models
* Proficiency in Python, R, SQL, or similar tools for data analysis and modeling, with a demonstrated ability to translate complex data into clear, actionable insights for both technical and non\-technical audiences
* Experience producing decision\-making tools—like research memos, behavioural deep dives, or experiment reports
* Experience assisting with discovery and roadmapping alongside product and engineering teams
* Curiosity, empathy, and a passion for understanding what drives people’s decisions

  


**Bonus points if you have**


* Experience working with Shopify or ecommerce platforms
* Familiarity with machine learning techniques, experimentation frameworks, or behavioural analytics
