You’ll be responsible for developing and maintaining the systems that power our generative workflows — including prompt orchestration, document retrieval, vector search, and model integration. You’ll work with unstructured brand assets like PDFs, campaign briefs, approved creative assets, and CMS content — transforming them into structured inputs for AI workflows that generate accurate, brand\-aware deliverables.
   

  

 This is a hands\-on, collaborative role for someone who’s passionate about building practical, production\-ready AI features — and excited by the idea of using modern applied ML in creative and business\-critical ways.
   

  

 This role is ideal for someone who’s comfortable working across both experimentation and implementation — from tuning prompts and embeddings to deploying services via Docker and cloud infrastructure.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Design and build AI\-powered systems for content generation, using LLMs, embeddings, and RAG techniques.
* Develop and maintain backend services that support AI workflows — including model inference, prompt orchestration, and data ingestion.
* Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and creative stakeholders to turn unstructured marketing data into structured, actionable inputs for AI.
* Integrate with vector databases and external APIs to enrich generation pipelines with relevant context.
* Monitor, evaluate, and iterate on model performance, cost, and latency in real\-world usage.
* Contribute to MLOps pipelines for training, testing, and deploying models into production environments.
* Support the development of scalable infrastructure for delivering AI features to end users and downstream systems (e.g., marketing platforms like Braze or Iterable).
* Participate in technical planning and help shape the direction of AI capabilities across the platform.


**About You**
**The essentials:**
* Strong proficiency in Python and experience with ML/AI libraries such as LangChain, Hugging Face, TensorFlow, scikit\-learn, or Transformers.
* Hands\-on experience with LLM APIs and vector databases — including tools like OpenAI, Anthropic, pgvector, Pinecone, or Weaviate — with a track record of building and deploying production\-ready AI features.
* Strong understanding of core NLP concepts such as text classification, entity recognition, semantic similarity, and vector\-based retrieval.
* Familiarity with modern LLM workflows, including prompt engineering, embedding generation, function calling, and retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.
* Comfort working with unstructured data such as brand guidelines, campaign briefs, PDFs, and CMS content.
* Practical experience with MLOps workflows — including model tracking, evaluation, and deployment — using tools like MLflow, Airflow, or similar.
* Experience building and deploying backend services using tools like FastAPI, Flask, or equivalent.
* A collaborative, product\-minded approach to building — you care about real\-world impact and working cross\-functionally.
* Comfortable deploying services using Docker and working with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, etc.).
* Prior work with product teams on LLM\-driven UIs or generative content workflows.


**Not a Must, But a Plus**
* Experience integrating AI features into MarTech ecosystems (Salesforce Marketing Cloud would be huge).
* Experience working with NVIDIA NIMs
* Experience with TypeScript and NestJS — helpful for collaborating with full\-stack teams or contributing to API infrastructure.
* Background in creative tooling, marketing automation, or content management systems.


**Benefits**
**What We Offer**
* Excellent, full coverage medical, dental, and vision insurance with employer\-paid HRA
* Generous PTO and 15 company\-wide holidays
* 401k with company contribution
* Paid parental leave
* Work\-life balance with an emphasis on personal well\-being
* Career growth in a disruptor space \& entrepreneurial opportunities within the Monks network
* A globally diverse \& inclusive culture with employee resource groups such as S4 Melanin, Pride.Monks, Cultura.Monks, and more!
* Authentic commitment to DEI efforts and sustainable growth. (Why Sir Martin Sorrell signed The Climate Pledge here!)


*Monks has provided a compensation range that represents its good faith estimate of what Monks may pay for the position at the time of posting. Monks may ultimately pay more or less than the posted compensation range. The salary offered to the selected candidate will be determined based on job\-related factors, but not based on a candidate’s sex or any other protected status.*

**Who we are looking for:**


At Faculty, your attitude and behaviour are just as important as your skill set. We look for individuals who can support our values, foster our culture and deliver for our organisation. We are a small business, and we need people who take the initiative. You will be given a high degree of autonomy, while still being given support as part of project teams, and formal opportunities to learn and develop.


We are looking for people that have the below attributes, however we encourage all applicants who believe themselves suitable for the role:

* Experience working in a consulting, economics or wider professional services role, including experience in a client or customer\-facing capacity. Alternatively, you may have such experience working in a software product or services company.

**ÜBER UNS** 




  





**Kijimea – Aus der Forschung. Für Dein Leben.** 
 Seit unserer Gründung im Jahr 2011 verfolgen wir eine klare Vision: Wir möchten das Potenzial der Mikrobiota (Bakterien) in unserem Darm gezielt nutzen für ein längeres und gesünderes Leben \- für alle Menschen.
 



  





 Ein erster großer Meilenstein auf diesem Weg gelang uns bereits 2013 mit der Entdeckung und klinischen Erforschung des einzigartigen Bakterienstamms
 *B. bifidum* 
 MIMBb75 (
 **Kijimea Reizdarm** 
 ). Seitdem konnten wir das Leben von Millionen Reizdarmpatienten weltweit spürbar verbessern. Heute gehört
 *B. bifidum* 
 MIMBb75 zu den am besten erforschten Bakterienstämmen weltweit. Seine Wirksamkeit und sein einzigartiger Wirkmechanismus wurden in zahlreichen klinischen Studien nachgewiesen und publiziert – u.a. in renommierten Fachzeitschriften wie
 **The Lancet** 
 .
 



  





 Wir arbeiten mit führenden Forschungsinstitutionen wie der Charité Berlin zusammen, um die Zusammenhänge zwischen der Mikrobiota (Bakterien in unserem Darm) und Allergien, Hautkrankheiten und psychischen Störungen zu erforschen. Kurz gesagt: Wir untersuchen, wie die Bakterien in unserem Darm Einfluss auf ein längeres und gesünderes Leben nehmen.
 



  





 Heute zählen wir zu den am schnellsten wachsenden Healthcare\-Unternehmen weltweit. Unsere Kunden erreichen wir über verschiedenste Kanäle: über die direkte Kommunikation mit Ärzten und Apothekern sowie Print\-, TV\- und Digitalmarketing. Um unser stark wachsendes Geschäft in Europa weiter auszubauen, suchen wir einen
 **Senior Data Analyst (Online Marketing),** 
 der uns bei dieser Mission unterstützt Unser Ziel ist klar definiert: Bis 2028 wollen wir Kijimea zur weltweit größten DTC\-Probiotikamarke machen und damit jährlich über 50 Millionen Menschen ein besseres Leben schenken.

**Portfolio \& Risk Management**

* **Actively monitor the performance of the loan book, identifying potential credit or operational risks early and collaborating with internal stakeholders to address them.**
* **Ensure regular communication with portfolio companies to both manage risk exposures and identify opportunities to deepen the lending relationship (e.g., providing additional financing solutions).**

**Market Development \& Strategy**

* **Work with senior leadership to shape the Warehouse Lending strategy and product roadmap in Europe, staying abreast of market trends.**
* **Strengthen the bank’s profile in the fintech ecosystem through networking, events, and targeted marketing efforts to broaden business opportunities.**

**Team Leadership \& Collaboration**

* **Collaborate with cross\-functional teams (credit, legal, compliance, and operations) to drive deals to completion and create scalable processes.**
* **Mentor junior team members, fostering a collaborative environment and promoting knowledge\-sharing.**

### **What We Are Looking For**

* **Educational Background**


	+ **Bachelor’s degree in Finance, Business, Economics, or similar field. MBA or CFA designation is a plus.**
* **Relevant Experience**


	+ **Minimum of 7 years’ experience in structured finance, warehouse lending, venture/growth lending, or a related debt capital role.**
	+ **Proven track record of leading debt transactions for fintech or technology\-focused borrowers.**
* **Technical \& Deal Execution Skills**


	+ **Strong understanding of receivables\-backed financing structures and fintech business models.**
	+ **Demonstrated expertise in financial modeling, credit analysis, legal documentation, and transaction closing processes.**
	+ **Familiarity with English/Common Law frameworks, bankruptcy remote structures and experience negotiating term sheets and credit documents.**
* **Client\-Centric Mindset**


	+ **Outstanding relationship management skills, with a focus on delivering solutions that support both clients’ strategic goals and the bank’s risk appetite.**
	+ **Ability to anticipate client needs, communicate complex financial concepts clearly, and build trust\-based partnerships.**

	+ **Passion for working in collaborative, diverse environments and guiding junior colleagues’ development.**

**About The National Energy System Operator (NESO)**
 In Autumn of 2024, the ESO transitioned to National Energy System Operator, or NESO for short. Previously denoted as the Future System Operator (or FSO), the new National Energy System Operator is the independent body responsible for planning Great Britain’s electricity and gas networks and operating the electricity system.
   

  

 The ESO, including all its existing roles, are now at the heart of the new National Energy System Operator. As NESO, we will build on our existing roles, capabilities, and ways of working significantly to create an organisation the energy system and its users’ need. Our new capabilities will enable us to look across vectors, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen, and crucially consider the trade\-offs between them.
   

  

 The organisation is set up as a public corporation with its own Board of independent directors, with complete operational independence from government, the regulator, and all commercial interest. As was the ESO, NESO will be licenced and regulated by Ofgem through price control agreements and obligated to identify optimal solutions to system operations and planning in the most sustainable, affordable, and secure way for all.
   

  

 The time to deliver is now. As part of our team, you won’t just be touching the lives of almost everyone in Great Britain – you’ll be shaping the way we use and consume energy for generations to come.

 We're making Africa the first cashless continent.
 


  


 In 2017, over half the population in Sub\-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.
 


  


 We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer\-to\-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.
 


  


 Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...
 


**How you’ll help us achieve it** 
  


 Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we’re still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people’s everyday lives.
 


  


 We’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist and help grow and strengthen our user base. You’ll work on high\-impact use cases with millions of users, such as optimizing our existing scratch card rewards program or designing and launching entirely new initiatives from scratch.
 


  


 The technical challenges range from crafting simple heuristics when data is sparse to applying advanced techniques like geospatial analytics, network analysis, and uplift modeling. You’ll own the full cycle: defining the right approach, implementing it, and shipping it in production.
 


  


 This role is highly experimentation\-driven: you’ll be able to rapidly test ideas, learn from real user feedback, and iterate quickly.
 


  


 We’re looking for someone who is product\-minded, hands\-on, and pragmatic: a data scientist who sees beyond models and algorithms and thinks deeply about how data connects to intuitive user behavior and real\-world impact.
 


  


 In this role you’ll:
 


  

  
* Be part of a multidisciplinary team, working with engineers, data analysts, economists and a product manager.
  
* Focus on advanced analytics and machine learning problems, delivering them end\-to\-end independently.
  
* Prioritise work and shape your own approach in a way that maximises the positive impact on both users and the business.
  
* Engage not just with business metrics, but also collaborate closely with Operations teams to understand the real\-world outcomes and impact of your work.
  


  

**Key Details** 
  

  
* You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC \-5 and \+2\) with reliable Internet access.
  
* Wave covers travel once per year to one of our operating countries in Africa, as well as a yearly stipend of $1,200 to meet with coworkers.
  
* Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level and location, we offer a salary of up to $149,200 USD (paid in your local currency equivalent), plus a generous equity package.
  
* Major benefits:
  
  
+ Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).
  
+ 6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.
  
+ Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 21\-30 days exclusive of statutory holidays.
  
+ $10,000 annual charitable donation matching.
  

  


  

**Requirements** 
  

  
* Education and Experience
  
  
+ Minimum Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or a related discipline. A Master's or PhD is a plus.
  
+ 4\+ years experience in applied data science or similar experience.
  
+ Demonstrated experience with data analysis, machine learning and product A/B tests.
  
+ Experience in using advanced analytics for optimising targeting, rewards or incentive programs is a big plus.
  

  
* Technical skills
  
  
+ Proficiency in applying machine learning methods to solve business problems.
  
+ Very strong Python skills with expertise in data manipulation, analysis and machine learning. Must be comfortable writing code that runs in production.
  
+ Competent in SQL.
  
+ Solid foundation in probability and statistics.
  

  


  

**You might be a good fit if you** 
  

  
* Thrive on spotting key problems and finding the fastest, most effective solutions.
  
* Enjoy and excel at working on machine learning and statistics problems.
  
* Quickly build and validate proof\-of\-concept solutions, refining based on real\-world feedback.
  
* Prefer pragmatic approaches but apply complex methods when the impact is worth it.
  
* Work iteratively, knowing when a project is “good enough” to avoid over\-polishing.
  
* Communicate insights clearly to all audiences and make confident, data\-driven recommendations.
  


  







  


  
 


 Our team
   

  
* We have a rapidly growing in\-country team in Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, and Uganda, plus remote team members spread across the world.
  
* We're deeply passionate about our mission of bringing radically affordable financial services to the people who need them most.
  
* We foster autonomy for our employees. You'll own your projects at every stage, from understanding the problem to monitoring your solution in production.
  
* We raised the largest Series A in Africa in 2021\. Our world\-class investors, include Founders Fund, Sequoia Heritage, Stripe, Ribbit Capital, Y Combinator, and Partech Africa.
  
* We are on Y Combinator's top companies by revenue.

**About You / Job Summary**


We're looking for an experienced and curious **QA Analyst** to lead the testing of our AI and GenAI\-powered features. This role goes beyond traditional SaaS QA — it requires a mindset for dealing with uncertainty, edge cases, model behaviour, and testing for quality when outcomes are not always predictable. If you're passionate about both automation and understanding how intelligent systems behave in the wild, we want to hear from you.  

  

You’ll be embedded in a cross\-functional scrum team, working closely with engineers, data scientists, and product managers to define and execute test strategies for AI features. You'll bring an automation\-first mindset but be comfortable with exploratory and manual testing when required — especially when testing model\-driven features. Your focus will include not just functional correctness, but also trust, safety, performance, and the overall quality of the AI experience.

**Key Accountabilities**

* Design, develop, and maintain test plans and automated test suites for AI/GenAI features across frontend and backend.
* Test complex AI\-driven systems where responses may vary — validate logic, relevance, completeness, tone, and safety.
* Build automation frameworks using **Playwright** and **Cucumber** with a focus on maintainability and scalability.
* Develop tools/scripts to validate model outputs and compare results across model versions (e.g. regression drift, hallucination checks).
* Define and execute non\-functional tests (e.g. performance under load, prompt injection resilience, fairness/bias testing).
* Log and manage defects effectively; collaborate in root cause analysis and prevention.
* Actively contribute to CI/CD testing pipelines to ensure fast, reliable releases.
* Stay current on trends in AI/ML testing and suggest improvements to our QA practices.

**Key role measures**

* **Automation Coverage \& Test Strategy Execution** \- Delivering and maintaining high levels of automated test coverage across AI/GenAI features, with a focus on scalable and maintainable test suites using Playwright and Cucumber.
* **Model Output Quality \& Safety Validation** \- Proactively identifying and validating issues in AI model outputs \- including hallucinations, bias, and prompt injection vulnerabilities \- to ensure safe, relevant, and trustworthy user experiences.
* **CI/CD Integration \& Test Reliability** \- Contributing to fast, stable releases by integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines and maintaining a low rate of flaky or failing tests.
* **Exploratory Testing \& Edge Case Discovery** \- Uncovering subtle bugs and edge cases through thoughtful exploratory testing, especially in areas where AI behaviour is less predictable \- making a meaningful impact from early in the role.

**Experience and skills**

**Our ideal candidate would have experience in the following areas:**


* Proven experience testing AI/ML\-powered systems, ideally including GenAI features (e.g. LLMs, chatbots, classifiers).
* Strong proficiency with **Playwright**, **Cucumber**, and automation\-first test strategies.
* Understanding of common GenAI testing challenges: non\-determinism, bias, hallucinations, injection attacks.
* Experience with prompt testing, output validation, or model comparison tools.
* Familiarity with REST APIs, JSON, and integrating model endpoints into test frameworks.
* Inquisitive and detail\-oriented mindset — able to challenge assumptions and uncover subtle issues.
* Experience in Agile/Scrum environments and collaborative cross\-functional teams.
* Familiarity with CI/CD tooling (e.g. Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or similar).
* Strong written and verbal communication skills.

**Nice to Have:**

* Background in machine learning or data science.
* Experience testing ethical/guardrail functionality in AI systems.
* Knowledge of data labelling, synthetic data generation, or test data management in AI contexts.

Familiarity with tools like OpenAI’s evals, LangChain testing modules, or similar frameworks.  

*

**The Role 💻** 

  
 




  





 We’re on the lookout for a Data Scientist to join a high\-performing team that powers the brain behind our sports betting platform. From building predictive models to identifying actionable insights, this role sits at the intersection of data, sport, and real\-time decision\-making. You’ll work closely with software engineers, traders, and product teams across time zones to develop data\-driven features and tools that are fast, scalable, and smart. 
 



  





 This isn’t a back\-office analytics gig — the role required being embedded in a product\-focused team where the work impacts live systems, trading strategies, and customer experiences. The ideal person will love working with real\-world data, solving complex problems, and shipping models into production. 
 



  






 Tech, stack and equipment you’ll be working with: 
 



* Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit\-learn, PyTorch, etc.)
* SQL \& NoSQL (Postgres, MongoDB, Cassandra or similar)
* Cloud\-native infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or OCI)
* ML Ops tooling (MLflow, Airflow, Docker, etc.)
* Realtime data pipelines (Kafka, Spark, etc.)
* Agile management tools (Asana)
* MacBook Air M3

**What you bring to the table 🫵** 

  
 




  





 Whilst we’re not looking for you to tick every single box, we are looking for someone who can keep pace with a fast\-moving team working at the intersection of data and sport. From experience, this is what that usually takes: 
 



  




* Solid foundations in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis
* Strong Python skills and familiarity with core data science libraries
* Experience working with large datasets and querying databases (SQL/NoSQL)
* A practical mindset for putting models into production and measuring their impact
* Comfort working in cross\-functional teams with engineers, product managers, and traders
* Excellent problem\-solving instincts and an eye for spotting signal in noise
* Clear, concise communication skills — written and verbal
* A degree (or equivalent experience) in Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related field
* An interest in sports




 Bonus points if you’ve worked in high\-velocity environments like finance, gaming, or sports analytics — or if you can explain a model
 
*and* 

 argue a referee decision.

Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end\-to\-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross\-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross\-border trade.

**About The Job**
 Google is an AI first company and is leading the efforts in principled AI adoption. We care about the quality of the machine learning data and models used in production. Towards this goal, we are directly supporting the Gemini team and other Product Areas. Our mission is to improve the quality of models that Google releases through its various product offerings by providing tools and services for making faster and easier to reach model quality goals.
   

  

 AI in the Gemini Era is data\-centric: the “quality” of the data used for training, fine\-tuning, or RAG, matters more to the performance of the end product than almost anything else. Where it becomes interesting is when we ask ourselves what “quality” means exactly and also what is the value of some specific data. It is very complex, model and use\-case dependent, and the techniques that approximate it the best are often found on the frontiers of research.
   

  

 Our mission is to improve the time to model quality for our users. We do so by bringing Data Optimization techniques to a broad audience through integrated tools and platforms. We build and iterate tools to automatically apply data optimization techniques. We demonstrate to our users which ones work best for their use case, and deliver insights on how to improve further. We are working with key product teams across Google.
   

  

 The US base salary range for this full\-time position is $166,000\-$244,000 \+ bonus \+ equity \+ benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job\-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.
   

  

 Please note that the compensation details listed in US role postings reflect the base salary only, and do not include bonus, equity, or benefits. Learn more about benefits at Google.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Work with data sets. Solve difficult, non\-routine analysis problems, applying analytical methods as needed. Conduct analysis that includes data gathering and requirements specification, processing, cleaning and curation, analysis, visualization, ongoing deliverables, and presentations.
* Share or present analysis to stakeholders and organization executives in order to share insights, influence product direction, and answer difficult questions regarding data quality measurement and impact on model performance.
* Build and prototype analysis pipelines to provide insights. Work with product teams to incorporate important analysis into existing framework and tools.
* Interact cross\-functionally with a wide variety of product and model teams. Work with engineers to identify opportunities for, design, and assess improvements of data quality and model performance.
