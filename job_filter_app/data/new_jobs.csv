At Shakers, we're on the lookout for a **Product Manager** to take our **Shakers Mind Squad** of the Product team to the next level


### **1\. Team and Role**

**Shakers MIND** is the knowledge and operations AI hub of Shakers, where we combine the reasoning power of general LLMs with our proprietary datasets to unlock insights and automate workflows across the company. It’s where we build the tools that make every team at Shakers 10x more productive.


The **Shakers MIND squad** is responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and implementing high\-impact AI applications together with internal teams, from Sales and Operations to Finance, People, and Product. This includes both building custom copilots and agents, and evaluating third\-party tools to accelerate our roadmap.


We’re looking for a **Product Manager to found and lead this squad**. You’ll have full ownership of the vision, team, and delivery. If you thrive at the intersection of AI, product strategy, and workflow automation, this is your playground.


You’ll report directly to the CPO and work side\-by\-side with engineers, data experts, and internal users across all departments.

### **2\. What you´ll be doing**

*Your day\-to\-day as a Shakers Mind Squad Product Manager****:***

* Own the full lifecycle of internal AI copilots and agents: from discovery and task design to tool orchestration, feedback loops, and impact measurement.
* Partner closely with stakeholders across Shakers (Sales, Ops, Finance, People, etc.) to uncover automation opportunities, deeply understand their workflows, and co\-create solutions that deliver measurable value.
* Lead the development of intelligent experiences across modalities, from embedded copilots to proactive nudges and eventually fully autonomous agents.
* Translate fuzzy ideas into structured problems, experiment fast, and validate assumptions early with real users and data.
* Build and manage a cross\-functional squad to deliver on Shakers MIND’s mission, defining rituals, scope, and velocity.
* Stay ahead of the curve: track breakthroughs in LLMs, agent frameworks, AI tools, and connect them to Shakers’ strategic roadmap.
* Work shoulder\-to\-shoulder with AI engineers and internal teams to iterate quickly. No ivory towers, this is a hands\-on role.
* Define and track metrics that reflect real impact: time saved, accuracy improved, process adoption, etc.
* Collaborate with the CPO and company leadership to align initiatives with long\-term vision and operational needs.

### **3\. What we´re looking for**

*You´re a great fit if you...*

* Have **4–8 years of experience as a Product Manager, with Technical background**, with exposure to AI/automation products or internal tooling platforms.
* Bring a **strong technical foundation**: you understand how LLMs work, how APIs are orchestrated, and how to design workflows using tools like n8n, BigQuery, OpenAI APIs, and Hubspot.
* Have hands\-on **experience with prompting**, from designing effective instructions for copilots to iterating prompts that power autonomous agent behaviors.
* Are **comfortable prototyping AI solutions** using low\-code/no\-code tools to validate assumptions quickly before committing to full development.
* Are **obsessed with improving workflows:** you ask the right questions, observe user pain points, and see automation not as a feature, but as leverage.
* **Thrive in ambiguity** and move from 0 to 1 with high ownership and minimal guidance.
* You **think like an owner**: you connect product decisions to business outcomes, and communicate clearly with both team members and company leadership.
* **Enjoy shaping AI UX patterns**, including prompts, user controls, nudges, and invisible automations.
* Know how to **balance long\-term vision with short\-term delivery**.
* Communicate clearly and persuasively in Spanish and English, and know how to align stakeholders around a product mission.
* **Align with Shakers’ values**: work fast, stay humble, chase 10x impact.

 Techmunity is hiring a Founding AI Engineer for a mission\-driven start\-up based in London that’s using cutting\-edge AI to support some of the most critical roles in our society: care professionals.
 



  





 With deep personal ties to the care sector, the founding team genuinely understands the challenges.
 



  





 Backed by £1\.1M in pre\-seed funding and several high\-impact commercial partnerships, they’re now growing a world\-class team to scale a platform already in use across children’s crisis homes, trauma recovery services, and frontline care.
 



  





**Why This Matters** 




 Social care is emotionally demanding and operationally complex. Staff are often stretched thin, spending precious time documenting care instead of delivering it.
 



  





 This companies platform helps by allowing care workers to speak or type natural, in\-the\-moment observations, which AI then transforms into structured, high\-trust insight.
 



  





 This isn’t just about reducing paperwork. It’s about:
 



  




* Supporting earlier intervention
* Improving safety and outcomes
* Giving staff more time to be present—not just compliant



  





**Your Role** 




 As Founding AI Engineer, you’ll join at a pivotal moment and lead the development of intelligent, agentic systems that sit at the heart of the platform.
 



  





 You’ll shape the long\-term technical direction while helping to make outstanding care more accessible, sustainable, and human.
 



  





**You will:** 



* Design and scale LLM\-powered workflows that transform messy, freeform data into clear, usable insight
* Build evaluation and feedback systems that proactively detect drift, hallucination, and other model failure modes
* Deploy reliable, observable AI infrastructure using LangChain, MLflow, Azure, LlamaIndex, and more
* Work across text, speech, and context, supporting multilingual, multimodal environments
* Collaborate closely with care professionals, designers, and engineers in short feedback loops
* Grow into a Head of AI role as the company and platform evolve



  





**What You Bring** 




 You don’t need to have done everything already. If you’ve built production AI systems and care about doing meaningful work, they’d love to hear from you.
 



  





 They’re especially looking for people who have:
 



  




* Experience shipping LLM or RAG\-based systems into production
* Strong skills in Python, Docker, and cloud environments (Azure preferred)
* Familiarity with prompt design, agent orchestration, and evaluation frameworks
* A pragmatic, inclusive, and user\-centred approach to engineering



  





 Bonus if you’ve worked in or adjacent to social care, healthcare, or other regulated, high\-stakes environments.
 



  





**What’s on Offer** 



* £80,000–£100,000 salary depending on experience
* 0\.25–1\.25% equity \- meaningful early\-stage ownership
* Hybrid working from our London HQ (WeWork, Canary Wharf)
* 25 days holiday plus bank holidays
* Annual learning budget for courses, tools, and conferences

Mana Robotics ist ein deutsches Startup, das die weltweit kleinsten, vollautonomen Kochroboter entwickelt – mit dem Ziel, das Kochen zu revolutionieren. Wir arbeiten hochfokussiert daran, Durchbrüche in den Bereichen KI und Robotik auf die Lebensmittelzubereitung anzuwenden.

Unsere Vision ist es, „Meal\-on\-Demand Streaming“ zu ermöglichen: kompakte Geräte, die überall und jederzeit ohne Aufwand frische und gesunde Mahlzeiten aus Rohzutaten zubereiten können – wie Netflix, aber für leckeres und gesundes Essen.

**Deine Rolle bei Mana**

Du wirst Machine Learning\-Methoden implementieren und weiterentwickeln, die es unseren Geräten ermöglichen, ihre Umgebung wahrzunehmen und zu interpretieren sowie Bewegungen zu generieren – mit dem Ziel, Zuverlässigkeit, Autonomie und das gesamte Nutzererlebnis zu verbessern.

Wenn dich Arbeit mit echtem Impact und greifbarer Anwendung begeistert, ist das deine Chance!

**In dieser Rolle wirst du**

* **Robot Learning** und **Computer Vision** Methoden zur Objekterkennung und Bewegungsplanung in unserer Kochumgebung implementieren und optimieren.
* Eine **Cloud\-Computing\-Architektur** für zentrale Roboter\-Koordination, Wahrnehmung und Planung entwickeln.
* Die **Systemzuverlässigkeit** über Edge\- und Cloud\-Komponenten hinweg testen – inklusive Fallback\-Strategien und Monitoring\-Tools.
* Aktuelle Forschungstrends in den Bereichen Cloud Robotics, Computer Vision und Robot Learning verfolgen – und diese pragmatisch in unsere Produkte einfließen lassen.

**Diese Rolle passt zu dir, wenn du**

* **Mindestens 3 Jahre praktische Erfahrung** in der Softwareentwicklung für Machine Learning\- oder Robotik\-Anwendungen hast.
* **Gerne in einem kleinen, schnelllebigen Team arbeitest**, in dem du viel Verantwortung und Gestaltungsfreiheit hast.
* **Leidenschaft für intelligente Systeme** mitbringst – von cloudbasierter Orchestrierung bis zu Perception Pipelines und Robot Learning\-Modellen.
* **Eine Growth\-Mindset mitbringst** und deine Fähigkeiten kontinuierlich weiterentwickelst, während du dich in einem dynamischen Technologiefeld bewegst.
* **Lust hast, vor Ort in unserem Dresdner Büro** zu arbeiten – in einem dynamischen, interdisziplinären Team, das die Grenzen des Machbaren in der ultra\-kompakten Robotik neu definiert.

**Deine Benefits**

* **Wettbewerbsfähiges Vergütungspaket** – deinem Impact entsprechend, bestehend aus Gehalt und weiteren Leistungen.
* **30 Urlaubstage pro Jahr** – Zeit, um aufzutanken, neue Ideen zu sammeln und mit frischer Energie zurückzukommen.
* Ein **modernes Büro im Zentrum von Dresden** – in schöner Lage nahe des Bahnhofs Dresden Neustadt für einen bequemen Arbeitsweg.
* Eine **motivierende, kollaborative Atmosphäre** – teile deine Ideen frei und experimentiere mit Cutting\-Edge\-Lösungen in einer Kultur, die Fortschritt fördert.
* **Flache Hierarchien mit echtem Impact** – schnelle Entscheidungen, echte Eigenverantwortung für Projekte und die Chance, Mana und deine eigene Entwicklung aktiv mitzugestalten.

**Mana ist anders**

Wir glauben nicht an eine bevorstehende Revolution, in der *humanoide* Roboter *alle* Aspekte von Leben und Wirtschaft verändern. Ein One\-Size\-Fits\-All\-Ansatz kann der Realität nicht gerecht werden – echte Herausforderungen erfordern oft spezialisierte Lösungen. Deshalb setzen wir auf *spezialisierte Robotiklösungen*, die neueste Fortschritte in Robot Learning und KI nutzen. Durch den Fokus auf *anwendungsspezifische Systeme* ermöglichen wir sowohl reale Markteinführung als auch *nahtlose Interaktion mit anderen Robotern*. Mit 8 Milliarden Menschen, die täglich Millionen Stunden in die Essenszubereitung investieren, stehen wir vor einer spannenden Mission.

Wir verzichten bewusst auf Hype\-getriebene Skalierung und massive Teamgrößen vor Erreichen des Product\-Market\-Fits. Stattdessen setzen wir auf ein extrem kleines Team hochqualifizierter Talente, um schnell agieren und uns flexibel anpassen zu können – entscheidend in den sich rasant entwickelnden Bereichen Robotik und KI.

Wir trennen nicht strikt zwischen Business und Technologie. Um die besten autonomen Kochlösungen der Welt zu liefern, erwarten wir von jedem – vom CEO bis zum neuesten Teammitglied – ein tiefes Verständnis für unser Produkt und unser Geschäft. Deshalb schätzen wir ambitionierte, breit aufgestellte Kolleg:innen, die Verantwortung übernehmen und Exzellenz anstreben. Bei uns trägt jede:r Einzelne viel Verantwortung – das fördert persönliches Wachstum und kontinuierliches Lernen ganz natürlich.

**Bereit, bei uns durchzustarten?**

Wenn du Lust hast, ein wirklich progressives Robotikprodukt im Herzen Europas mitzugestalten, freuen wir uns auf deine Nachricht! Schreib uns mit einer individuellen Vorstellung deiner Stärken und bring gerne deinen aktuellen Lebenslauf mit:

 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally.

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

**More About Hopper**
 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.

**About us**
------------

  

At National Energy System Operator (NESO), we’re aiming to operate a zero\-carbon electricity system for Great Britain by 2030 when there is sufficient renewable generation. This means change is needed across the whole system to transition away from fossil fuels and deliver clean, and affordable energy for everyone across the country.


Join a journey that matters.


Your energy, our future, together.

 **About the National Energy System Operator (NESO)**

  

In Autumn of 2024, the ESO transitioned to National Energy System Operator, or NESO for short. Previously denoted as the Future System Operator (or FSO), the new National Energy System Operator is the independent body responsible for planning Great Britain’s electricity and gas networks and operating the electricity system.


The ESO, including all its existing roles, are now at the heart of the new National Energy System Operator. As NESO, we will build on our existing roles, capabilities, and ways of working significantly to create an organisation the energy system and its users’ need. Our new capabilities will enable us to look across vectors, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen, and crucially consider the trade\-offs between them.


The organisation is set up as a public corporation with its own Board of independent directors, with complete operational independence from government, the regulator, and all commercial interest. As was the ESO, NESO will be licenced and regulated by Ofgem through price control agreements and obligated to identify optimal solutions to system operations and planning in the most sustainable, affordable, and secure way for all.


The time to deliver is now. As part of our team, you won’t just be touching the lives of almost everyone in Great Britain – you’ll be shaping the way we use and consume energy for generations to come.

This role closes on **13th July at 23:59**, however we encourage candidates to submit their application as early as possible and not wait until the published closing date as this can vary.

  

We work towards the highest standards in everything we do, including how we support, value, and develop our people. Our aim is to encourage and support employees to thrive and be the best they can be. We celebrate the difference people can bring into our organisation, and welcome and encourage applicants with diverse experiences and backgrounds, and offer flexible and tailored support, at home and in the office.

 At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.
   

  

 From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.
   





**About the team** 




 We don't build pricing models, we build the driving intelligence that feeds them. Our mission is to drive safer roads and fairer insurance through data.
 



 The Telematics team transforms raw phone sensor data into meaningful insights about how people drive. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, we process high\-frequency data to extract behavioural signals that power our understanding of driving quality, context, and risk.
   





**About the Role** 




 As a Senior Data Scientist, you'll help define the future of behaviour\-based insurance. You'll own the development of features and algorithms that detect driving patterns from sensors, test new hypotheses, and bring the most impactful insights into production.
 



 You'll work at the intersection of data science and engineering, generating scalable, real\-world insights from GPS, accelerometer, and other data
   





**What you will be doing** 



+ Design and build robust behavioural features and factors from telematics data


+ Develop end\-to\-end pipelines in Python and SQL, from quick heuristics to full ML models


+ Prioritise simple, robust solutions that scale, whether rule\-based or ML\-driven


+ Collaborate with Software Engineers and Product Managers to deploy features and validate impact


+ Lead experiments, explore new ideas, and automate insight generation


+ Translate complex sensor data into clear findings for internal use and product development



**About You** 



+ MSc or equivalent industry experience in a relevant field (e.g. Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Statistics). Candidates with a BSc and strong production experience will also be considered


+ Experience delivering data science or data engineering solutions into production. You're comfortable writing production\-grade code, not just notebooks


+ Strong Python and SQL skills, including the basic libraries (Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn). You value writing clean, maintainable, and tested code


+ Proven ability to design, build, and maintain data pipelines and tools from scratch that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable

**More About Hopper**
 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
   

  

 Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   

  

 Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1\.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
   

  

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.
   

  

 Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest\-growing mobile\-first travel marketplace.

Join a purpose driven winning team, committed to results, in an inclusive and high\-performing culture.

 **Job Title: Senior Manager, Decisioning Models \- Retail \& Small Business**

  



We are committed to investing in our employees and helping you continue your career at Scotiabank.


The world is changing faster than ever and so are we! “*Big data*”, “*machine learning*” and “*AI*” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever\-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results\-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.


Our goal is to be nothing less than *The Leading Bank in The Americas* by putting *Customers First.* Achieving this requires a *Winning Team* that can build, manage, and govern stable high\-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk\-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $millions safe every single day.

 **What We Are Looking For?**

  

We want talented, pragmatic analytically oriented data scientists who are equally at home interpreting and applying statistics as they are ingesting and massaging data, translating regulatory requirements into models, and explaining complex issues in simple concise ways. We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about *everything* (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right – the first time – and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.

  

To be a Senior Manager in Retail and Small Business Models, Analytics \& Strategy, it isn’t enough to just be a great **model developer** (though that is incredibly important as well); you also need to be an **aspiring leader** who dreams about ownership and accountability (i.e., “the buck stops here”), a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy data sets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important.

 **Make an Impact**


As a Senior Manager, you will report directly to a director, likely with 1\-3 direct reports of your own, and you will be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of decisioning models and analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance – **models covering the Bank’s retail and small business product lines in Canada and Internationally**. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners which may include Retail Credit Risk and Business, Capital, Provisioning, Model Operations, Enterprise Stress Testing, Model Validation and Governance, Technology \& Data, Finance, Compliance and Audit.

  

You will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on\-premise GPU computing, open source Jupiter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.

  

Under the guidance of your director, your team of risk modeling experts will use these tools to develop advanced risk prediction models that will be used to make decisions worth $millions every month and therefore they need to be not only precise and accurate, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure, and useful. You will be responsible for understanding the goals \& priorities set for you, executing them efficiently with a perpetual eye on quality, asking questions often and delivering results in harmony with your teammates.

 **Is This Role Right for You?**

  

* You believe, first and foremost, in always doing the right thing and doing things the right way.
* You are both deeply curious and highly pragmatic.
* You are comfortable with ambitious but realistic goals and are committed to achieving them.
* You are social, engaging, not afraid to ask questions and relish the opportunity to learn from partners across the firm (who may be less technical than you)
* You relish the opportunity and yet also understand the responsibility and weight that comes with the fact that the output of your models will directly influence the bank’s financial statements or decisions that impacts a real human being.
* You have a genuine love, passion and talent for programming, data, and predictive modeling.
* You are committed to quality in everything you do – statistically, process and governance wise.
* You look forward to sharing your insights through high\-quality verbal \& written communications.

 **Sample projects that you might work on include:**

* Complete specialized analysis, develop statistical solutions and recommend improvements to estimation techniques and/or forecasting and decisioning models.
* Collaborate with risk management, vendors, technology, foreign counterparts, and compliance \+audit to ensure effective governance, measurement \& communication of model performance.
* Conduct research of new innovative modeling methodologies, tools, and regulatory requirements
* Lead the periodic monitoring, recalibration and maintenance of models and analytic tools.
* Identify, promote, and lead process improvements for model development and monitoring.
* Ensure that the data used for model development is reliable and robust and that it adheres to industry and regulatory standards.

 **What Do You Need to Succeed?**

 **General**

* Bachelor’s degree in mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, or an equivalent technical field
* A demonstrated history of analytic problem solving and sound judgment.
* Experience as an analyst or data scientist with a track record of accomplishments working on cross\-functional teams.
* Strong verbal and written communications skills: the ability to distill abstract business requirements into analysis, concisely convey technical outcomes, tell a story visually with data, prepare and edit high\-quality documentation and be accepted as a trusted advisor by peers.
* Able to work remotely and on\-site on multiple activities simultaneously and meet deadlines.

 **Technical**

* Strong fundamental understanding of statistics
* 3\+ years of overall experience in analytic roles developing and using predictive, risk and/or forecasting models.
* Highly proficient in one or more analytical programming languages (Python, R, SAS, etc.), SQL (Teradata, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server) and multiple environments (Unix \& Windows)
* 1 or more years of experience with big data platforms / integration (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Avro)
* Knowledge about credit risk models / scorecards

 **Nice to Have's**

* Proficient reading, writing, and speaking Spanish.
* Experience developing credit risk models / scorecards.
* Experience training and deploying machine learning models using common Python open\-source frameworks (i.e., scikit\-learn) and/or Python DevOps
* Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Teams, PowerBI) power user
* Experience working with FICO / TSYS / CGI decision systems (TRIAD, OM, ACE, CACS)

 **What’s in It for You?**

  

* We have an inclusive and collaborative work environment that values curiosity \& ownership, encourages pragmatic creativity (i.e. true innovation), and celebrates success!
* You'll get to work with and learn from an incredibly friendly and diverse group of accomplished leaders.
* Access to thousands of online and in person courses so you can brush up on skills or learn new ones.
* Multiple career paths and innumerable progression opportunities. We hire you for your talent and not just for the job. We want to see you succeed not just in your role but in your career as a whole.
* A competitive rewards package that includes a base salary, a performance bonus, company matching programs on pension and profit sharing, paid vacation, personal \& sick days, medical, vision and dental benefits that start from day one and much more!

**About The Opportunity**
 Jerry is looking for a
 **Data scientist** 
 to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data\-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0\-1, etc.). As part of the data science \& analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in\-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.
   

  

 Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI\-powered chatbot \& voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.
   

  

**Here's what an ex\-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:**
*""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business\-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C\-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).*
*The benefit of being a digital\-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.*
*I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""*
**How You Will Make An Impact**
* Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
* Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
* Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
* Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency


**Preferred Experience**
* Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
* 1\-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
* High level of comfort with SQL or Python

 Join a purpose driven winning team, committed to results, in an inclusive and high\-performing culture.
   

  

**Job Title: Senior Manager, Decisioning Models \- Retail \& Small Business**
 We are committed to investing in our employees and helping you continue your career at Scotiabank.
   

  

 The world is changing faster than ever and so are we! “
 *Big data* 
 ”, “
 *machine learning* 
 ” and “
 *AI* 
 ” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever\-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results\-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.
   

  

 Our goal is to be nothing less than
 *The Leading Bank in The Americas* 
 by putting
 *Customers First.* 
 Achieving this requires a
 *Winning Team* 
 that can build, manage, and govern stable high\-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk\-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $millions safe every single day.
   

  

**What We Are Looking For?**
 We want talented, pragmatic analytically oriented data scientists who are equally at home interpreting and applying statistics as they are ingesting and massaging data, translating regulatory requirements into models, and explaining complex issues in simple concise ways. We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about
 *everything* 
 (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right – the first time – and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.
   

  

 To be a Senior Manager in Retail and Small Business Models, Analytics \& Strategy, it isn’t enough to just be a great
 **model developer** 
 (though that is incredibly important as well); you also need to be an
 **aspiring leader** 
 who dreams about ownership and accountability (i.e., “the buck stops here”), a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy data sets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important.
   

  

**Make an Impact**
 As a Senior Manager, you will report directly to a director, likely with 1\-3 direct reports of your own, and you will be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of decisioning models and analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance –
 **models covering the Bank’s retail and small business product lines in Canada and Internationally** 
 . You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners which may include Retail Credit Risk and Business, Capital, Provisioning, Model Operations, Enterprise Stress Testing, Model Validation and Governance, Technology \& Data, Finance, Compliance and Audit.
   

  

 You will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on\-premise GPU computing, open source Jupiter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.
   

  

 Under the guidance of your director, your team of risk modeling experts will use these tools to develop advanced risk prediction models that will be used to make decisions worth $millions every month and therefore they need to be not only precise and accurate, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure, and useful. You will be responsible for understanding the goals \& priorities set for you, executing them efficiently with a perpetual eye on quality, asking questions often and delivering results in harmony with your teammates.
   

  

**Is This Role Right for You?**
* You believe, first and foremost, in always doing the right thing and doing things the right way.
* You are both deeply curious and highly pragmatic.
* You are comfortable with ambitious but realistic goals and are committed to achieving them.
* You are social, engaging, not afraid to ask questions and relish the opportunity to learn from partners across the firm (who may be less technical than you)
* You relish the opportunity and yet also understand the responsibility and weight that comes with the fact that the output of your models will directly influence the bank’s financial statements or decisions that impacts a real human being.
* You have a genuine love, passion and talent for programming, data, and predictive modeling.
* You are committed to quality in everything you do – statistically, process and governance wise.
* You look forward to sharing your insights through high\-quality verbal \& written communications.


**Sample Projects That You Might Work On Include**
* Complete specialized analysis, develop statistical solutions and recommend improvements to estimation techniques and/or forecasting and decisioning models.
* Collaborate with risk management, vendors, technology, foreign counterparts, and compliance \+audit to ensure effective governance, measurement \& communication of model performance.
* Conduct research of new innovative modeling methodologies, tools, and regulatory requirements
* Lead the periodic monitoring, recalibration and maintenance of models and analytic tools.
* Identify, promote, and lead process improvements for model development and monitoring.
* Ensure that the data used for model development is reliable and robust and that it adheres to industry and regulatory standards.


**What Do You Need to Succeed?**
**General**
* Bachelor’s degree in mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, or an equivalent technical field
* A demonstrated history of analytic problem solving and sound judgment.
* Experience as an analyst or data scientist with a track record of accomplishments working on cross\-functional teams.
* Strong verbal and written communications skills: the ability to distill abstract business requirements into analysis, concisely convey technical outcomes, tell a story visually with data, prepare and edit high\-quality documentation and be accepted as a trusted advisor by peers.
* Able to work remotely and on\-site on multiple activities simultaneously and meet deadlines.


**Technical**
* Strong fundamental understanding of statistics
* 3\+ years of overall experience in analytic roles developing and using predictive, risk and/or forecasting models.
* Highly proficient in one or more analytical programming languages (Python, R, SAS, etc.), SQL (Teradata, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server) and multiple environments (Unix \& Windows)
* 1 or more years of experience with big data platforms / integration (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Avro)
* Knowledge about credit risk models / scorecards


**Nice to Have's**
* Proficient reading, writing, and speaking Spanish.
* Experience developing credit risk models / scorecards.
* Experience training and deploying machine learning models using common Python open\-source frameworks (i.e., scikit\-learn) and/or Python DevOps
* Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Teams, PowerBI) power user
* Experience working with FICO / TSYS / CGI decision systems (TRIAD, OM, ACE, CACS)


**What’s in It for You?**
* We have an inclusive and collaborative work environment that values curiosity \& ownership, encourages pragmatic creativity (i.e. true innovation), and celebrates success!
* You'll get to work with and learn from an incredibly friendly and diverse group of accomplished leaders.
* Access to thousands of online and in person courses so you can brush up on skills or learn new ones.
* Multiple career paths and innumerable progression opportunities. We hire you for your talent and not just for the job. We want to see you succeed not just in your role but in your career as a whole.
* A competitive rewards package that includes a base salary, a performance bonus, company matching programs on pension and profit sharing, paid vacation, personal \& sick days, medical, vision and dental benefits that start from day one and much more!

**More About Hopper**
 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
   

  

 Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   

  

 Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1\.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
   

  

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.
