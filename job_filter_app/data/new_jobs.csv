 Hey, it's great that you've found us. Are you ready for a challenge? Perhaps we have just the right opportunity for you. At holi.social, we believe in the power of community and want to help people turn their ideas into reality and make a positive impact together.
   

  

 That's why we're working to create a new digital ecosystem. A digital hub that removes obstacles for all involved, allowing them to channel their energy into the social projects they believe in. At the same time, we're building the digital home for social initiatives with the goal of collectively scaling their impact digitally. To learn more about holi, we invite you to have a closer look into our vision and dive into our web app.
   

  

 To make this vision reality, we’re building powerful tools behind the scenes \- and that’s where you come in.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Our Data \& Matching team is building the data backbone for social impact. We develop intelligent recommendation systems that connect people with the opportunities where they can make the greatest difference \- turning intention into meaningful action.
   

  

 You'll be working closely with our Product Manager to develop ambitious product visions and transform them into appropriate and evolvable technical solutions. We have already created a few data pipelines, but we are looking for someone that can take our efforts to the next level in creating a production\-grade data infrastructure that is cost efficient and flexible.
   

  

****What You'll Build****
**Data Infrastructure \& Pipelines**
* Design and maintain robust data pipelines for recommendation
* Build a data architecture supporting content\-based and behavioural recommendations
* Ensure high data quality, freshness, and reliability in production systems
* Crawl and enrich external data sources, calculate embeddings for matching algorithms


**Product\-Driven Recommendations**
* Extend our recommendation system across all content types (e.g. volunteering opportunities, events, posts, etc.)
* Power personalized content feeds, search results, and recommendations using behavioural data
* Implement smart filtering (e.g. hide previously viewed content, boost content with higher engagement probability)
* Design A/B testing frameworks to validate recommendation performance


**Strategic Technical Leadership**

* Experience with modern data stacks and cloud platforms (preferably Google Cloud)
* Understanding of data quality testing, monitoring, and observability
* A sound engineering background


**Product \& Communication Excellence**
* Think from the users perspective \- you want to solve real problems, not just build cool tech
* Excellent written and verbal communication for our remote\-first environment
* Ability to translate technical complexity into clear business impact
* Experience validating features and measuring success in production


**Working Style**
* High autonomy with strong alignment \- you can drive initiatives independently while staying connected with the team
* ""More engineer than scientist"" \- you apply sound methodologies but focus on shipping reliable solutions
* Strategic thinking \- you can be a sparring partner for product and technical strategy, not just an executor
* Curious about the latest innovations in AI \& data engineering


**Our Tech Stack**
 We build holi in a way that allows the vast majority of people to participate, regardless of the device they are using. That's why we're building a web technology\-based foundation for cross\-platform apps that work on popular mobile devices as well as on computers.
   

  

 The app is based on an up\-to\-date React Native codebase that drives Expo\-delivered mobile apps and a Next.JS web app. The frontends connect to a monolithic Django/Python\-based backend and a range of Deno Typescript services via Apollo\-mediated GraphQL. The data pipeline codebase you’ll spend most of your time in is written in Python, uses Prefect as task orchestrator, processes data from BigQuery \& Google Cloud Pub/Sub, uses Vertex AI and ingests into Typesense as search engine \& vector database.
   

  

 We already achieved a high grade of automation with regards to Continuous Integration, Testing and Deployment and are at home in the Google Cloud Platform. We are Open Source, if you’re interested in details, check our documentation.
   

  

**What We Offer**
**Find your WHY:** 
 holi.social is changing the way people engage in social causes \- empowering initiatives to thrive and individuals to take meaningful action. Join us and become part of a growing movement for social impact.
   

  

**Remote\-first:** 
 Work from anywhere in Europe with flexible hours (CET ±2\). Join us for biannual retreats, and help shape social change through technology. Prefer in\-person connection? You're always welcome at our offices in Hamburg or Berlin.
   

  

**Flexible time off:** 
 We believe in balance. That’s why we offer a minimum of 25 vacation days \- with no set maximum. Whether you need rest, time with family, or space for personal growth, it’s all possible here.
   

  

**Genuine team spirit:** 
 Beyond our digital routines, we come together at least twice a year for in\-person co\-working, connection, and shared learning. The Data \& Matching team also gathers annually for dedicated team\-building activities.
   

  

**Give back:** 
 Every quarter, you can use one workday to support a social cause close to your heart.
   

  

**Mental Health First:** 
 Your wellbeing matters. We have trained Mental Health First Aiders on our team and provide all employees with access to Nilo Health’s mental health support platform.

 What You’ll Get
 


* £80,000–£100,000 salary depending on experience
* 0\.25–1\.25% equity – early and meaningful
* Hybrid working from Canary Wharf HQ
* 25 days holiday \+ bank holidays
* Annual learning budget for courses, tools, or conferences

**About Us** 




 We didn’t start out as a traditional security product. In the beginning, Glasswall was one of only two file sanitisation filters in the US Intelligence Community’s highly classified networks. We are rated \#1 by the National Security Agency. We designed Glasswall CDR to protect businesses against the most advanced file\-based threats. Today, we’re trusted by commercial and government organisations around the world.
 



 In June 2025 Glasswall officially entered a new era of growth and innovation having been acquired by the leading private equity firm, PSG Equity. This marks a significant milestone for our company—one that underscores the strength of our business, the dedication of our team, and the exciting potential that lies ahead.
 



 With PSG’s strong track record of scaling high\-growth cybersecurity and technology businesses, we are better positioned than ever to accelerate innovation, expand into new markets, and deliver even greater value to our clients, employees, and stakeholders.
 



 Cybersecurity is a mission\-critical field, and we’ve always believed that staying ahead means moving faster, continually adapting to meet new challenges and investing more boldly in the future. This partnership empowers us to do exactly that—while maintaining the same leadership, values, and commitment to excellence that have brought us this far
 



 We’re excited for what’s to come—so now is a great time for you to join us on our journey.
 



  





**Inclusion** 




 At Glasswall we believe that diversity of people and thought are central to our purpose. We are committed to making Glasswall a company that is attractive to people of many different backgrounds. This includes diversity in every sense of the word: those with different backgrounds, ages, ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, ways of thinking and those with disabilities or neurodivergent conditions. We therefore welcome and encourage applications from everyone, including those from groups that are under\-represented in our workforce.
 



 One of our corporate objectives is to ensure that the organisational health of the firm is highly rated by our employees. We believe that this is only possible if we promote a culture of inclusion and respect across our business. Every six months we survey employees on a range of questions relating to our organisational health. This holds a mirror\-up to a business and ensures that we can focus on where we need to do better.
 



 We have an Organisational Health Committee, which is chaired by a non\-executive position. The panel has been formed to guide the leadership in taking positive action that supports a good work\-life balance, family friendly relations and to be inviting to a diverse range of potential employees.
 



 We also have a Women in Technology Group which has been formed to promote balance in the way that we communicate with, promote, encourage, and support people across our business.
 



  





**Work/Life Balance:** 




 Our team puts a high value on work\-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life\-long happiness and fulfilment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

* Glasswall offers a competitive salary.
* Performance related bonus scheme.

Hey, it's great that you've found us. Are you ready for a challenge? Perhaps we have just the right opportunity for you. At holi.social, we believe in the power of community and want to help people turn their ideas into reality and make a positive impact together.


That's why we're working to create a new digital ecosystem. A digital hub that removes obstacles for all involved, allowing them to channel their energy into the social projects they believe in. At the same time, we're building the digital home for social initiatives with the goal of collectively scaling their impact digitally. To learn more about holi, we invite you to have a closer look into our vision and dive into our web app.


To make this vision reality, we’re building powerful tools behind the scenes \- and that’s where you come in.

 **About the role**


Our Data \& Matching team is building the data backbone for social impact. We develop intelligent recommendation systems that connect people with the opportunities where they can make the greatest difference \- turning intention into meaningful action.


You'll be working closely with our Product Manager to develop ambitious product visions and transform them into appropriate and evolvable technical solutions. We have already created a few data pipelines, but we are looking for someone that can take our efforts to the next level in creating a production\-grade data infrastructure that is cost efficient and flexible.

**What You'll Build**
---------------------

**Data Infrastructure \& Pipelines**

* Design and maintain robust data pipelines for recommendation
* Build a data architecture supporting content\-based and behavioural recommendations
* Ensure high data quality, freshness, and reliability in production systems
* Crawl and enrich external data sources, calculate embeddings for matching algorithms

**Product\-Driven Recommendations**

* Extend our recommendation system across all content types (e.g. volunteering opportunities, events, posts, etc.)
* Power personalized content feeds, search results, and recommendations using behavioural data
* Implement smart filtering (e.g. hide previously viewed content, boost content with higher engagement probability)
* Design A/B testing frameworks to validate recommendation performance

**Strategic Technical Leadership**

* Co\-create a long\-term data strategy and roadmap with Product Management
* Break down complex product ideas into feasible technical phases
* Challenge current approaches and bring modern data stack perspectives
* Drive technical decisions balancing innovation with pragmatic delivery

#### **What we're looking for**

**Core Technical Skills**

* Production experience building and evolving data pipelines
* Strong background in recommendation systems (content\-based, collaborative filtering, behavioural)
* Experience with modern data stacks and cloud platforms (preferably Google Cloud)
* Understanding of data quality testing, monitoring, and observability
* A sound engineering background

* Think from the users perspective \- you want to solve real problems, not just build cool tech
* Excellent written and verbal communication for our remote\-first environment
* Ability to translate technical complexity into clear business impact
* Experience validating features and measuring success in production

**Working Style**

* High autonomy with strong alignment \- you can drive initiatives independently while staying connected with the team
* ""More engineer than scientist"" \- you apply sound methodologies but focus on shipping reliable solutions
* Strategic thinking \- you can be a sparring partner for product and technical strategy, not just an executor
* Curious about the latest innovations in AI \& data engineering

**Our Tech Stack**  

We build holi in a way that allows the vast majority of people to participate, regardless of the device they are using. That's why we're building a web technology\-based foundation for cross\-platform apps that work on popular mobile devices as well as on computers.


The app is based on an up\-to\-date React Native codebase that drives Expo\-delivered mobile apps and a Next.JS web app. The frontends connect to a monolithic Django/Python\-based backend and a range of Deno Typescript services via Apollo\-mediated GraphQL. The data pipeline codebase you’ll spend most of your time in is written in Python, uses Prefect as task orchestrator, processes data from BigQuery \& Google Cloud Pub/Sub, uses Vertex AI and ingests into Typesense as search engine \& vector database.


We already achieved a high grade of automation with regards to Continuous Integration, Testing and Deployment and are at home in the Google Cloud Platform. We are Open Source, if you’re interested in details, check our documentation.

#### **What we offer**

**Find your WHY:** holi.social is changing the way people engage in social causes \- empowering initiatives to thrive and individuals to take meaningful action. Join us and become part of a growing movement for social impact.

**Remote\-first:** Work from anywhere in Europe with flexible hours (CET ±2\). Join us for biannual retreats, and help shape social change through technology. Prefer in\-person connection? You're always welcome at our offices in Hamburg or Berlin.

**Flexible time off:** We believe in balance. That’s why we offer a minimum of 25 vacation days \- with no set maximum. Whether you need rest, time with family, or space for personal growth, it’s all possible here.

**Genuine team spirit:** Beyond our digital routines, we come together at least twice a year for in\-person co\-working, connection, and shared learning. The Data \& Matching team also gathers annually for dedicated team\-building activities.

**Give back:** Every quarter, you can use one workday to support a social cause close to your heart.

**Mental Health First:** Your wellbeing matters. We have trained Mental Health First Aiders on our team and provide all employees with access to Nilo Health’s mental health support platform.

**Recruiting Process:**
-----------------------

 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
   

  

 Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   

  

 Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1\.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
   

  

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.
   

  

 Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest\-growing mobile\-first travel marketplace.

**More About Hopper**
 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
   

  

 Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   

  

 Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1\.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
   

  

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.

**More About Hopper**
 At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world\-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
   

  

 The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
   

  

 While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
   

  

 Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end\-to\-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
   

  

 Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   

  

 Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1\.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
   

  

 Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no\-questions\-asked resolutions.
   

  

 Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
   

  

 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
   

  

 Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the \#3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen\-Z and millennials travelers.
   

  

 Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest\-growing mobile\-first travel marketplace.

* You’ve unlocked meaningful insights that have directly informed team priorities, product iterations, or operational improvements — and made those insights accessible to both technical and non\-technical stakeholders.
* You’ve meaningfully contributed to the development and operation of our optimization models, supporting the data science team in scaling and improving the intelligence behind smart charging and pricing strategies.

**This role in a nutshell**
---------------------------



We're looking for a **Staff Conversation Designer** to lead the design of intelligent, helpful and intuitive experiences across OVO's digital and human\-assisted channels. This is not a typical content design role. You'll be shaping how our customers interact with AI\-powered systems across the business, from LLM assistants to retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows. You'll design systems that interpret, respond and act intelligently, helping customers manage their energy with clarity, confidence and less effort.


**Your key outcomes will be**
-----------------------------


### **Strategic Design and Ownership**

* Set design direction for conversational AI across multiple teams or products, ensuring coherence, consistency and scalability
* Identify where conversational AI can make a real difference to the user experience and product outcomes
* Influence product direction and help shape how and where AI is introduced to drive the most value

* Write, structure and optimise LLM prompts for clarity, accuracy and performance, while maintaining a consistent brand voice
* Define and implement interaction patterns for both stateless and stateful dialogue systems
* Prototype, test and iterate conversational experiences to improve usability and system performance, using tools like Voiceflow, Rasa, LangChain or custom orchestration frameworks
* Contribute to the development of prompt libraries, vector\-based memory systems and safety guardrails to improve scalability and control
* Lead prompt engineering and optimisation for LLMs and agent\-based systems, including the design of function\-calling flows and structured output handling

### **Collaboration and Leadership**


* Work closely with designers, engineers, product managers and data scientists to shape and ship great conversational experiences
* Facilitate workshops and design sprints to drive ideas and alignment across teams
* Define and document best practices, playbooks or training to support adoption of conversational AI patterns and systems
* Coach and mentor others, raising the bar for conversation design and AI thinking across the team
* Clearly explain design decisions and technical concepts to a wide range of audiences

### **Tools and Methodologies**


* Confident using tools like Figma, Miro and conversational design platforms, alongside AI development environments such as the Gemini API, Postman and prompt engineering sandboxes
* Experienced in evaluating AI interactions using metrics such as fallback rate, hallucination rate, token usage, response latency and user satisfaction
* Work closely with ML engineers and backend developers to define integration points, orchestrate AI behaviours and ensure system performance
* Understand the constraints of LLMs, including context windows, API limitations and prompt token budgets
* Apply an agile, iterative approach, working in short cycles to learn and ship quickly

* Contribute to the appropriate Community of Practice (CoP) by leading discussions, sharing practices, and offering firsthand experience to the wider community
* Create content and individually contribute to the stated successful outcomes for this CoP
* Help shape how conversation design evolves as a discipline within OVO and beyond

**You'll be a successful Staff Conversation Designer if you**
-------------------------------------------------------------


* Think beyond copy and flows and take a systems\-level view of how AI experiences are designed and delivered
* Have hands\-on experience designing for chatbots, voice assistants or intelligent agents, with a strong portfolio to back it up
* Understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and can design within those constraints
* Care deeply about the user and use research, performance data and feedback to guide your decisions
* Can switch between high\-level thinking and fine\-tuned craft, and know when to zoom in or out
* Communicate well with both technical and non\-technical teams and are comfortable challenging assumptions
* Are curious, proactive and comfortable working in fast\-moving, ambiguous environments
* Have a working knowledge of how LLMs are deployed in production, including prompt orchestration, agent behaviour and data retrieval methods


**You won't like this role if you…**


* Struggle with ambiguity, shifting priorities or shaping clarity where none exists, especially in the context of fast\-moving AI technologies
* Prefer to execute on predefined solutions rather than driving the vision, strategy and standards for conversational AI at scale
* Are uncomfortable influencing across multiple teams or guiding complex work through a mix of direct contribution, facilitation and stakeholder alignment
* See conversation design as a copywriting task rather than a systems design discipline grounded in logic, architecture and machine learning principles
* Are not deeply engaged with the ethical, social and technical responsibilities of designing AI systems that affect real people
* Avoid hands\-on collaboration with engineers, data scientists and product leads to build, test and evolve AI\-driven experiences in production environments


**Let's talk about what's in it for you**



We'll pay you between £75k \- £90k depending on your specific skills and experience. If your expectations are a little different, have a chat with us!

 At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.
   

  

 From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.
   





**About the team** 




 We don't build pricing models, we build the driving intelligence that feeds them. Our mission is to drive safer roads and fairer insurance through data.
 



 The Telematics team transforms raw phone sensor data into meaningful insights about how people drive. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning, we process high\-frequency data to extract behavioural signals that power our understanding of driving quality, context, and risk.
   





**About the Role** 




 As a Senior Data Scientist, you'll help define the future of behaviour\-based insurance. You'll own the development of features and algorithms that detect driving patterns from sensors, test new hypotheses, and bring the most impactful insights into production.
 



 You'll work at the intersection of data science and engineering, generating scalable, real\-world insights from GPS, accelerometer, and other data
   





**What you will be doing** 



+ Design and build robust behavioural features and factors from telematics data


+ Develop end\-to\-end pipelines in Python and SQL, from quick heuristics to full ML models


+ Prioritise simple, robust solutions that scale, whether rule\-based or ML\-driven


+ Collaborate with Software Engineers and Product Managers to deploy features and validate impact


+ Lead experiments, explore new ideas, and automate insight generation


+ Translate complex sensor data into clear findings for internal use and product development



**About You** 



+ MSc or equivalent industry experience in a relevant field (e.g. Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Statistics). Candidates with a BSc and strong production experience will also be considered


+ Experience delivering data science or data engineering solutions into production. You're comfortable writing production\-grade code, not just notebooks


+ Strong Python and SQL skills, including the basic libraries (Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn). You value writing clean, maintainable, and tested code


+ Proven ability to design, build, and maintain data pipelines and tools from scratch that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable

**🚀 The Role**
 As a
 **Senior Product Data Analyst** 
 , you will be the
 **analytical backbone** 
 of our product teams, transforming raw behavioural data into powerful insights that shape strategy, roadmap and user experience. You’ll take part in designing and building the
 **end\-to\-end data workflow** 
 —from working with engineers to instrumenting events, modelling data in dbt, and delivering clear, compelling narratives that empower us to
 **\#ActFast on :70 % evidence** 
 . We believe that most decisions are reversible, so we value smart risks and rapid iteration.
   

  

**👥 The Team**
 At ZOE, we're on a mission to empower people with the most advanced science and technology to transform their health. Our Product Analytics team plays a central role in this mission, turning data into insights that shape product strategy and drive high\-impact decisions. We collaborate with product managers, designers, engineers, and scientists to ensure that every feature we build improves the experience and outcomes for our members. By leveraging data and experimentation, we continuously refine our products to deliver meaningful value and measurable health improvements. The team is composed of four members with a mix of analytics engineering and data analysis skills, and we also work closely with data scientists.
   

  

**🎯 What You’ll Be Doing**
* Design and iterate on core product metrics (user activation, retention, engagement, and monetisation), ensuring they are accurate, timely, and reliable
* Build and maintain lightweight, test\-covered ELT pipelines (Fivetran → BigQuery → dbt → Hex) that make clean data accessible to everyone
* Prototype analyses in SQL/Python, starting with the simplest approach and layering complexity only when it materially sharpens the answer.
* Partner with Product Managers to plan A/B tests, quantify opportunities, and identify friction points in the user journey.
* Ship dashboards and ad\-hoc decks that persuade—clarity and narrative first, visuals and stats in service of the story.
* Champion a product\-mindset culture: ask “so what?” on every query, translate findings into actionable next steps, and iterate quickly when the market proves us wrong.


**🧠 What You’ll Bring To The Table**
* Have 5 \+ years of professional experience in data analytics. Hold a bachelor’s (or advanced) degree in a quantitative field, e.g., Stats, Maths, CS, Physics, Engineering, or Economics.
* Enjoy tackling \*\*\*\*open\-ended questions and finding elegant, unexpected solutions. You combine intellectual curiosity with a creative approach to problem\-solving.
* Are fluent in SQL and comfortable coding in Python; you’ve touched dbt or other data transformation tools, or you’re a quick learner.
* Have handled real\-world data messiness before (missing events, conflicting definitions) and know how to get to “good enough” without getting stuck.
* Treat statistics as a power tool, not a party trick—confident with basic stats and able to recognise when fancier models are (or aren’t) worth it.
* Thrive in an early\-stage environment with high ownership, tight deadlines, and rapid iteration. You're comfortable with less process and enjoy seeing fast feedback loops.
* Thrive in early\-stage environments: little process, high ownership, tight deadlines, rapid iteration, and feedback loops measured in days.
* Communicate crisply—whether writing a one\-pager for leadership, debating trade\-offs with engineers, or walking non\-technical teammates through a funnel drop\-off chart.
* Live our \#ActFast value—you’re happy to move on :70 % evidence because speed beats perfection in a startup. You recognise most calls are reversible, avoid reinventing the wheel, take smart risks, and pivot quickly, knowing the team has your back.

**Remote Philosophy**
 ZOE is a remote\-first company, meaning remote work isn’t just an option — it’s how we work best. We are intentional about building a distributed, high\-performing team where collaboration, trust, and flexibility thrive.
   

  

 We design our workflows around asynchronous communication and shared documentation to support autonomy, focus, and cross\-timezone collaboration. While our teams work independently, connection and teamwork remain central to how we operate — through regular rituals, meaningful virtual interactions, and in\-person gatherings every quarter. These include team offsites and a yearly company\-wide retreat to build relationships, spark creativity, and have fun together.
   

  

 Being remote\-first also means we value outcomes over hours and trust our team members to manage their work in a way that suits their unique rhythm and responsibilities. This approach allows us to support a truly flexible work environment, while staying aligned with our mission and values.
   

  

 At ZOE, working remotely doesn’t mean working alone — it means being empowered, supported, and connected, wherever you are.
   

  

**Compensation Philosophy**
 We are committed to offering competitive and equitable compensation that reflects the value of each role and aligns with regional labor market standards. Our approach to compensation goes beyond just base salary — we offer a comprehensive package that includes base pay and stock options, ensuring that every team member is rewarded for their contributions to the company’s growth and success.
   

  

 We believe that building a thriving team requires not only providing fair and competitive compensation but also fostering an environment where success is shared collectively. Our total compensation package is designed to support the well\-being of our employees, recognise their individual contributions, and empower them to grow alongside ZOE.
   

  

**Benefits \& Perks**
 We understand the significant role our benefits play in motivating, inspiring and safeguarding our employees' well\-being. Our benefits strategy is thoughtfully designed to echo our mission and values, recognising the diverse needs arising from different life stages of our ZOEntists.
   

  

 Our approach to benefits takes an inclusive and flexible view of both personal and professional growth. From competitive health insurance and wellness packages to inclusive parental policies, building connection, and tailored professional development programs, we've got you covered.
   

  

 At ZOE, we continue to build a benefits package that invests in our team members’ long\-term personal and professional growth and wellbeing, adding to this list as it evolves.
   

  

**Equal opportunities**
 We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive team where every individual can bring their authentic self to work. We believe that this is key to our success and are dedicated to positively impacting the tech industry. As part of our commitment to equal opportunities, we encourage candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to apply. We ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all and do not discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, marital status, disability, or age.

**Reporting to:** 
 Chief Technology Officer
 



  





 Kelpi is a world\-leading sustainable materials innovation company, using seaweed and natural plant\-based oils to create a unique coating material that provides the sort of barrier to moisture that could previously only be achieved by fossil fuel plastics. This renewably sourced coating is then applied to paper and card to create recyclable packaging which is bio\-degradable. Even if it ends up at sea, Kelpi\-coated paper and card will break down naturally, leaving no toxins nor microplastics behind.
 



  





 Kelpi is looking for a Data Scientist to join our rapidly growing team comprising world\-class scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. 
 **Please note, we are also open to considering part\-time candidates for this position!**

 We are looking for a self\-motivated, creative team player who is passionate about sustainability and wants to make a positive impact in the world. Each member of our team helps shape the growth and culture of Kelpi, so we hope that you will take an active role in how we develop our strategy, our products, and how we work together. 
 



  





 You’ll be our first Data Scientist at Kelpi, and so you will have a lot of autonomy in leading this new area of the business – holding a key position at the heart of our purpose\-driven business. You therefore should be organised, have a strong work ethic, and show an innovative and methodical approach to problem solving. 
 



  






 You should have:
 



* Background in Machine Learning, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science or a related field (MSc or PhD ideal, but open to strong BSc candidates)
* Hands\-on experience with Bayesian optimization, ideally in noisy or low\-data regimes
* Familiarity with probabilistic modelling and the underlying mathematical/ statistical principles.
* Demonstrable experience with machine learning frameworks such as JAX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, particularly for model development and optimization tasks.
* Proficiency in data wrangling, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.
* Curiosity, autonomy, and ability to work in a fast\-paced, interdisciplinary startup environment
* Bonus: Experience with materials informatics, chemistry, or sustainability\-focused projects
* Excellent communication skills (and we will empower you to have the confidence to argue your case!)
* The collaboration skills to work with mixed projects teams in a fast\-paced environment
* Eagerness to learn and contribute within a dynamic and agile team setting, bringing new ideas to life.



  






 Your role
 




 As a Data Scientist, you’ll work at the intersection of materials science and AI, designing and implementing data\-driven methods to optimise formulations and performance of sustainable materials. You'll own the data science function, collaborating closely with our R\&D and product teams to accelerate experimentation and discovery. Your work will contribute directly to our mission of advancing sustainable solutions for coatings and packaging.
 



  






 Tasks involve:
 



* Lead the development and integration of optimisation models to guide formulation and material design experiments
* Build data pipelines and analytical models to extract insights from lab data and improve the speed and quality of performance optimisation.
* Work with materials scientists to design efficient experimental plans (active learning, DoE)
* Build and manage our internal data science workflows and tooling
* Communicate insights clearly to technical and non\-technical stakeholders
* Stay current with relevant literature and tools in optimisation and materials informatics
* Contributing to brainstorming sessions and team discussions by sharing insights and observations.



  






 What we offer
 



* In addition to a competitive compensation package and growth opportunities within a startup environment, the Data Scientist will participate in our Employee Share Ownership Programme.
* We offer additional benefits, such as a health cashback scheme, cycle scheme, and enhanced family\-related leave and pay.
* You will have access to a generous budget for personal and professional development.
* A work life balance is important to us \- we offer 25 days annual leave (in addition to the 8 bank holidays), additional ‘Kelpi’ days, charity days and social events.
* Opportunities to contribute to meaningful work that is addressing the world’s biggest sustainability challenges.



  






 Where you will be based
 




 This is a position based at our modern lab and office space in central Bristol. We are open to considering full\-time and part\-time candidates.

* Collaborating closely with Data Scientists and Software Engineers to deliver impactful solutions
* Leading cross\-functional teams to build and deploy NLP and AI solutions, such as customer\-facing chatbots, search engine optimisations, co\-pilots, etc.
* Setting your team's goals, success metrics, and roadmap to align with Revolut’s mission
* Delivering measurable results for sophisticated products under ambiguous situations in a fast\-paced environment


What you'll need

* Experience developing and launching AI products from scratch
* High analytical and technical acumen, along with solid business sense and problem\-solving skills

* Knowledge of version control, model deployment, and developer environments
* Evidence of impressive mathematical and statistics knowledge


Compensation range

*Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D\&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers.

**Here's what an ex\-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:**
*""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business\-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C\-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).*
*The benefit of being a digital\-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.*
*I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""*

### **Job summary**


The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) is an executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food \& Rural Affairs, and works on behalf of the Scottish Government and Welsh Government. Our diverse teams of over 3,000 skilled and committed professionals come together to provide research, advice and support to UK Government for safeguarding animal, public and plant health for benefit of the environment and economy.


The Science Directorate (SD) delivers high quality, high impact and highly relevant multidisciplinary science. Our People are diverse, talented, engaged and inspired to deliver innovative outcomes.


This is an exciting opportunity for a Technical Data Engineer to be involved in new improvements being made to APHA’s data that informs intelligence for animal diseases. **This post is a fixed\-term appointment, funded through the Cabinet Office as part of the National Biosurveillance Network Private Vet Labs Project.**


The APHA’s Surveillance Intelligence Unit (SIU) is a multidisciplinary team that is responsible for collecting, collating, presenting and analysing livestock scanning (passive) surveillance data generated within APHA. Increasingly, data from third parties (including commercial private veterinary laboratories, veterinary practitioners and abattoirs) is also being harnessed to augment scanning surveillance outputs. The data and analyses are used to produce routine reports and other outputs relating to endemic diseases of animals in Great Britain for the benefit of a wide range of stakeholders, including the livestock industry, private veterinary surgeons and producers.


This new post is funded through the National Biosurveillance Programme (NBN), which is a component of the UK’s Biological Security Strategy (BSS), which outlines the UK’s cross government mission to achieve resilience to a spectrum of biological threats. The NBN aims to improve the UK’s ability to characterise and report biological risks across the One Health spectrum, reliably and rapidly. This includes improving ways of working to better record, share and utilise surveillance outputs, and bringing data together to generate a holistic picture of risks.


The post sits within a dedicated multidisciplinary NBN team in APHA and will work closely with the SIU team, in particular the team of Data Analysts within SIU.

### **Job description**


This role will provide a data and information management function directly contributing to the outputs of the animal health scanning surveillance network in Great Britain.


The successful applicant will be directly involved in the collection, curation and analysis of animal health scanning surveillance data primarily by building, updating and maintaining automated data ingestion and processing pipelines in a cloud\-based environment using existing APHA surveillance data as well as animal health data from third party sources that augments current outputs and enhances APHA’s scanning surveillance capabilities.


The post\-holder will initially work with an existing developer team to define data handling capabilities within the SIU team and will be subsequently responsible for maintaining and scaling data ingestion processes to an increasing number of datasets. The post\-holder will also provide functional management of other members of the SIU team, identifying suitable training opportunities and providing support and mentoring as required to deliver resilience of skills and experience across the team.


The SIU is a geographically dispersed team that works effectively at a distance using tools such as Microsoft Teams. However, it will be necessary to travel occasionally to other locations for training sessions and workshops where face\-to\-face participation is beneficial for both the individual and the team.


More information about the work of these teams is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal\-disease\-scanning\-surveillance\-at\-apha


As part of on\-going efforts to utilise scanning surveillance data from multiple external providers and collaborators, APHA is working to develop modern, cloud\-based tools that will enable efficient and consistent data preparation, visualisation and analysis. Currently, a contractor delivery team is developing a system to enable secure data submissions through an online portal and the development of pipelines that will automate many of the data\-handling tasks that are currently performed manually.


The post will work with the SIU and delivery teams to understand data\-handling requirements for data from multiple providers and to make full use of the tools being developed to write and implement data pipelines that will efficiently – and where possible, automatically – ingest, process, store and prepare data for visualisation and further analysis.


The post will also help to characterise business change requirements as new tools enter business\-as\-usual workflow and will support and mentor existing members of the SIU team by identifying training requirements and appropriate learning opportunities to build team resilience and maximise potential benefits.


More specifically, in this role you will:

* Work with data providers and the delivery team to determine data processing and access needs and how best to deliver them.
* Create and support data pipelines and storage solutions (e.g. data warehouses).
* Develop and deliver automation of data infrastructure and deployments.
* Mentor team members to build resilience and expertise in data pipeline.
* Help improve the team’s data capabilities.
### **Person specification**

**You will need to demonstrate the following:**

* Significant experience working on data pipelines, platforms and projects.
* Experience in developing solutions in one or more of the main Cloud providers (e.g. Azure, AWS).
* Strong background in Python programming language.
* Working with a variety of databases, data warehouses and distributed file systems in production environments.
* Strong experience in SQL and data modelling.
* Experience of using dashboarding tools, preferably Tableau.
* Working with source control and infrastructure as code (e.g. Git/Github) and CI/CD tools.
* Exposure with data processing at scale.
* Knowledge about GDPR and data security.
* Understanding and being able to support data scientists or business intelligence teams in data preparation, mentoring and support functions.
* Strong collaboration and communication skills, including the ability to communicate effectively while working with nationally distributed teams.
* Willingness and ability to travel as required to face to face events, such as training and workshops.
* Interest in animal health surveillance systems in England and Wales.


A valid full driving licence is necessary or access to an alternative means of transport.

### **Behaviours**


We'll assess you against these behaviours during the selection process:


* Changing and Improving
* Working Together
* Developing Self and Others
* Seeing the Big Picture


We only ask for evidence of these behaviours on your application form:

### **You’ll Thrive Here If You...**

* Own outcomes, not just code \- you measure success by real\-world impact
* Navigate ambiguity like a pro \- no detailed spec? You create one
* Love startup speed \- quick iterations, shifting priorities, and building fast don't scare you
* Solve messy problems from first principles \- you bring structure where there was none
* Move fast but think deeply \- your solutions are pragmatic, not just theoretical
* Embrace feedback, experimentation, and learning as core to how you grow
* Believe that working with great teammates makes you better \- and you do the same for them
* Are endlessly curious and never stop leveling up your technical depth

### **Requirements**
